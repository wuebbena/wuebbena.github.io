<div xml:id="preface-div-1"><p><pb n="[i]" facs="https://gutenberg-capture.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454133"/>1. The 1944 edition of the "Bomber's Baed [xxx] revised and amplified version of Part III [xxx] edition, which it replaces. It has been ext [xxx] scope to cover all towns in Germany (regardless of size) which are of any industrial significance, and it has been possible to expand the number of industrial establishments listed in each town. Information relating to the activities of particular factories has been revised in the light of the latest available intelligence.</p></div>
<div xml:id="preface-div-2"><p>2. As in the previous edition, enterprises have been grouped under fourteen industrial headings as follows:- 1. Transportation 2. Public Utility Services 3. Solid Fuels 4. Liquid Fuels and Substitutes 5. Iron, Steel, and Ferro-Alloys 6. Non-Ferrous Metal Smelting, Refining, and Manufacture 7. Aircraft and Aero-engines 8. Shipbuilding 9. Other Engineering and Armament Industries 10. Chemicals and Explosives 11. Textiles, Rayon, Pulp and Paper 12. Rubber and Tyres 13. Leather 14. Food industries </p></div>
<div xml:id="preface-div-3"><p>3. The descriptions of activities and the figures in the column entitled "Priority" are intended only as a general guide to the size and relative importance of the individual undertakings. The basis on which the "Priority" ratings have been allotted is as follows:-
<list><item><label>1+</label> Factories of outstanding importance in the German war effort. </item>
<item><label>1</label> Major plants in major industries </item>
<item><label>2 </label>Minor plants in major industries or Major plants in minor industries </item>
<item><label>3 </label>Factories of relatively small importance in the German war effort. </item>
<item><label>-</label> Factories which are almost certainly of little importance in the German war effort and establishments concerning which the available information is not sufficient to enable any priority rating to be allotted.</item></list></p>
<p><pb n="ii" facs="https://gutenberg-capture.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454134"/>Some of the works included without priority are new establishments the activities of which are uncertain; some of them would doubtless rank for inclusion in one of the four priority groups if full information were available.</p>
<p>In allotting priorities account has been taken of the damage inflicted in area attack only in cases where the productivity of the factory concerned appears to have been permanently affected. In other cases factories are assessed on the basis that they have been fully repaired and are fully active. Owing to the speed with which repairs are put in hand in some cases, it did not seem practicable to give weight to damage which may prove to be temporary in assessing priorities which are intended for long-term reference. The priority rating of a factory in the Bomber's Baedeker consequently does not necessarily reflect its current importance and should not be used for the purpose of appreciations without reference to its current damage status. If the demand from users justifies it, however, periodical statements can be issued to show the current status of damaged factories as well as other amendments. </p></div>
<div xml:id="preface-div-4"><p>4. Owing to its increased size it has been necessary to bind the new edition in two parts, of which the first includes, in alphabetical order, the towns AACHEN to KÜSTRIN; and the second the towns LAHR to ZWICKAU. Each part is accompanied by maps showing: -<list>
<item><label>a)</label> All towns covered by the 1944 edition of the Bomber's Baedeker. </item>
<item><label>b) </label>The method of division of the industrial area of the Ruhr into fourteen districts.</item></list></p>
<p>An index is in course of preparation. </p></div>
<div xml:id="preface-div-5"><p>5. Enquiries relating to this report should be addressed to:- E.B.3 Enemy Branch (F.O. and M.E.W.) Lansdowne House, Berkeley Square, London, W.1. Enemy Branch, (Foreign Office and Ministry of Economic Warfare). May 1944</p>

</population></placeName><p>Aachen is an important railway junction on one of the main routes from North-West Germany into Belgium and France. It is the centre of a large coal-mining area, and many of the companies exploiting these mines have their administrative offices in the town. In peace-time textiles formed the main industry in Aachen proper. There are a large number of spinning and weaving mills, many of which were closed early in the war. The leading firms of Aachen's engineering and rubber industry are mentioned below. The town has been heavily damaged by bombing, and the production of several of these firms reduced, but much of the industrial damage, particularly to the main factories, has been repaired. The industries are mainly grouped in the North East corner of the town along the Jülicherstrasse, and in the Rothe Erde district, east of the town centre. Several of the textile mills in the Jülicherstrasse, which have been closed down, are now said to be used as dummies. The central part of the town is closely built, and has largely preserved its mediaeval character.</p><list type="industries_infrastructure">

From the Aachen-West Station, a main line leads North East to Krefeld and the Ruhr. These are the trunk lines which connect the industrial Rhineland direct with Antwerp and, through the Meuse valley, with North Eastern France.

Photographic cover of September, 1941,suggests that the plant is engaged primarily in the production of finished propellant powders, but does not show it to be extremely large. On the other hand, a variety of reports received in 1942 and 1943 suggest that great extensions have been made during the last two years, the proposed completion date being given as September, 1943. In view of the number of such reports, it must be assumed that a very considerable powder factory now exists at this site, but it is not possible to give an estimate of its capacity.

</population></placeName><p>General Introduction Berlin, the capital of the German Reich, and the third largest city in the world, is not only the political and economic administrative centre of Germany, but ranks also as the most important industrial and manufacturing city on the Continent of Europe. The suburbs and built-up area extends from East to West for some 20 miles, and from North to South approximately 17 miles. The administrative boundaries have been extended by the inclusion of surrounding districts to give a total area of 345 square miles. The chief industrial areas lie firstly, to the North-west, including Spandau, Siemenstadt, Wedding, Tegel, and Reinickendorf, and secondly, to the South and South-east including Marienfelde, Tempelhof, and Johannistal. There are other well-established industrial areas, such as Lichtenberg and Schöneberg, which are respectively in the eastern and southern quarters of the city. Further industrial extension is taking place in various outlying portions of the administrative area. The course of the river Spree, which is navigable, runs approximately from South-east to North-west through the centre of the city. At Spandau it joins the Havel, which flows from North to South along the western border of Berlin. The Teltow canal, which leaves the Spree near Treptow and runs through the Southern outskirts of Greater Berlin, joins the Havel near Potsdam and forms a link to relieve the water-borne traffic through the centre of the city. Great use has been made of the waterways around Berlin in order to connect the capital with the Elbe and the Oder. Large inland harbours have been constructed. The most important of which is the Westhafen, where 70 large ships can be loaded simultaneously. The Westhafen is connected with the Spree and with the Havel, which it joins at Spandau. From the Havel (North-west of Berlin) ship canals have been built giving direct access in the East to the Oder, and in the West to the Elbe. By this means navigable waterways connect Berlin directly with Stettin and the Baltic, and with Hamburg. The main railway artery between Western and North-eastern Europe runs through Berlin. There are three large railway stations on this East to West line. In addition main lines radiate from five other terminal railway stations to all parts of Germany. The local and suburban traffic is served by the electric Stadt- und Ringbahn, the extensive network of which extends over the whole area. This is supplemented by the large system of the Hoch- und Untergrundbahn, which runs partly underground and partly as an elevated railway, and by the tramway and bus services. All the leading firms have administrative offices in Berlin. These are largely concentrated in the central city area between Alexanderplatz and the Eastern end of Unter den Linden, and also in the neighbourhood of the Potsdammerplatz. Running South from the Western end of Unter den Linden is the Wilhelmstrasse, in which are situated the Chancellery, the War Office, the Air Ministry and other Government departments. <pb n="32a" facs="https://gutenberg-capture.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454167"/>The principal shopping centres of Berlin, which contain several large department stores, are Leipzigerstrasse, Alexanderplatz, and Tauentzienstrasse, in Charlottenburg. Industries The firmly established and significant position held by the industries of Berlin within the German productive machine is primarily due to their scope and diversity, both of which have been further developed during the war. The electro-technical industry (including radio) still maintains its important and leading position and is represented by large firms of world-wide repute such as the A.E.G., Siemens and Halske A.G., Siemens Schuckert A.G., and Telefunken Ges. für Drahtlose Telegraphie m.b.H., Osram G.m.b.H., and others. The general engineering industry is also of substantial importance, as is shown by the well-known firms engaged in it, such as Rheinmetall Borsig A.G., Ambi-Budd Presswerke G.m.b.H., Deutsche Industriewerke A.G., Berliner Maschinenbau A.G. (vormals L. Schwartzkopff), and Daimler-Benz A.G.; it is, in fact, Berlin's second-largest branch of industry. The aircraft industry is represented by B.M.W., Dornier, Heinkel and Focke-Wulf, and general engineering by numerous makers of precision tool and of precision and optical instruments. Berlin's chemical, clothing, and food industries, are also of more than local importance. Industrial Areas The chief industrial areas are located outside the Ringbahn, along the water and railway routes. These routes are arranged in three main belts:- the river Spree and the canals associated with it; the railway which encircles the outskirts of the compact built-up area, i.e., the Ringbahn; and an outer ring of conmunications which consist of the Havel and Tegel See to the West, the Teltow canal from Potsdam to Köpenick to the South, and the Industrie
Bahn to the North from Tegel to Lichtenberg. An important feature of the three outstanding industrial areas is that there are only small residential areas in their immediate vicinity. In order of importance these are:- (1) Spandau, Charlottenburg, and Siemenstadt. This west-central part of Berlin is of the highest importance. Here there are very big blocks of factory buildings and also a special port. Among others, the electrical equipment and cableworks of Siemens and Halske A.G., Siemens Schuckert A.G., A.E.G. Turbinenfabrik, the Ges. für Elektrische Unternehmungen L. Loewe A.G., Osram G.m.b.H., and the B.M.W. are located there. The second and third largest of the BEWAG power stations are also in this area. (2) Treptow and Schöneweide. The manufacture of electrical equipment of all kinds is predominant within this area, and, although the A.E.G. has its largest individual plant at Brunnenstrasse, Wedding, the three most important electrical equipment and cable works of the company are to be found here. The most important of Berlin's non-ferrous metal plants and the main works of the important Accumulatoren Fabrik A.G. (A.F.A.) <pb n="33" xml:id="page_33" facs="https://gutenberg-capture.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454168"/>are located in the Schöneweide district. There are other engineering works, motor vehicle and metal works. The largest of the BEWAG power stations is at Rummelsburg, near the Treptow area. (3) Tegel, Wittenau, and Reinickendorf. Important engineering and armament-production plants are to befound here. The most prominent of these are the Dornier and the Heinkel air-craft-components factories, the Argus aero-engine factory, Maschinenfabrik Prometheus G.m.b.H., and the Deutsche Waffen- und Munitions-Fabriken A.G. To the North there are many snail and scattered factories, the chief of which are at Lichtenberg, where Siemens Planiawerke and a number of other engineering works are located. To the South, at Mariendorf, Tempelhof and Britz, the chief factories lie on the South side of the Tempelhof airfield. Industries are also to be found on the Eastern outskirts of Neukölln. The suburban areas, most of which lie far outside Berlin, have been developed mainly during the last twenty years. As a rule they are largely residential, but in some cases industrial development has taken place. The greatest extensions have been made along the railways to the North-west towards Hennigsdorf and Oranienburg; to the North-east to Bernau: to the East beyond Mahlsdorf: to the South-east beyond Köpenick to Wildau; to the South to Lichtenrade: and to the South-west around the South of the Havel See to Potsdam.</p>

<p>General The city is supplied from external sources chiefly by the EWAG and the MEW systems. The BKL (BEWAG) controls all the main power stations in the city. The total capacity of the generating stations is 1,250 MW. External Supply There are two main outside systems of supply to the city. The first, the EWAG system, supplies current from Golpa-Zschornewitz and Trattendorf. These lines enter Berlin at Spandau and at Rummelsburg and thence are linked up to the BKL (BEWAG) system. Two lines come from Trattendorf; one skirts the northern suburbs and enters at Spandau, the other connects with BKL (BEWAG) system at Friedrichsfelde. The other is the MEW system, which encircles Berlin and introduces current from the power stations at Finkenheerd, Finow, and Hennigsdorf. Berliner Kraft- und Licht (BEWAG)- A.G. "Deutsche Edison" was founded in 1883 and in the following year was granted a concession to supply electrical current to part of the city of Berlin. This concession was transferred to the Städtische Elektrizitätswerke on its formation. Later, this company became the Berliner Elektrizitätswerke (BEW), and the concession was extended to cover the whole of the city of Berlin. In 1915 the city itself took over the direction of the firm under the name Städtische Elektrizitätswerke Berlin (STEW), but this was again altered in 1923 to Berliner Städtische Elektrizitätswerke Akt. Ges. (BEWAG). In 1931 the Berliner Kraft- und Licht-Aktiengesellschaft (BKL) was formed to administer the electrical installations owned directly by the city and those owned by BEWAG. The BEWAG capital was transferred to the new company and two other Berlin companies - Elektrowerke A.G. (EWAG) and Preussische Elektrizitäts Aktiengesellschaft- also became shareholders of the new company. Finally, in 1934, BEWAG and BKL were completely amalgamated to form the present Berliner Kraft- und Licht (BEWAG) - A.G. In 1938, BKL (BEWAG) - the new company - acquired the firm of Elektrizitätswerk Südwest A.G. (ESA) and so widened its territorial interests to Schöneberg, Wilmersdorf and <pb n="35" xml:id="page_35" facs="https://gutenberg-capture.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454174"/>Schmargendorf. In the same year, as a result of an agreement made in 1928, it acquired from Märkisches Elektrizitätswerk A.G. (MEW) territorial interests in Dahlem, Lankwitz, Lichtenrade, Mariendorf, Südende, and Tempelhof. Thus BKL (BEWAG ) acquired the interests in the whole of the city as far as the small outlying districts of Wannsee and Buch. The company claims that this is the largest system of electrical manufacture and distribution in any one city in the world.</p>

<p>General Up to 1939 gas supply in Berlin was undertaken by two companies, the Berliner Städtische Gaswerke A.G., with works at Charlottenburg Danziger Str. Lichtenberg Neukölln Tegel leased to the company by the Municipality, and the Gasbetriebsgesellschaft A.G., a subsidiary of the Deutsche Gasgesellschaft A.G., with works at Gitschinerstr. Schöneberg Mariendorf In 1936 the Berliner Städtische Gaswerke sold 390,600,000 cu. m. of gas and the Gasbetriebsgesellschaft 133 million cu. m. In 1939 the Berliner Städtische Gaswerke (Gasag) took over from the Deutsche Gasgesellschaft the operation of its three Berlin works, and thus unified gas supply in the city. In Greater Berlin there still remained, however, two independent municipal gas-distributing concerns, those at Niederbarnim and Teltow. Of these the former obtains gas from the GASAG, and the latter from the Potsdam works of the Deutsche Continental-Gas-Gesellschaft.</p>

The plant produces iodine and bismuth preparations, and a proprietary product "Atophan" (cinchophen, for the treatment of gout). Staff employed were 1,000 clerical, 200 research chemists, and 500 other workers, before the war. Berlin-Charlottenburg: All buildings of this factory are leased to other firms with the exception of one floor where the bacteriological research is carried on. It also finished the preparation of insulin supplied by the Berlin-Adlershof plant. All products were sent to Berlin-Wedding for packing and distribution. This plant employed 50 research workers. <pb n="58" xml:id="page_58" facs="https://gutenberg-capture.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454198"/>Berlin-Adlershof: The bulk of the pharmaceutical products is carried out at this factory. A large variety of products are manufactured, including hormones, pharmaceutical ether, synthetic narcotics (e.g. veramon), Urotropine (Hexamethylene tetramins) and a variety of mixed preparations, commercial solvents, reagents for laboratory works, and numerous fine chemicals are also made. Semi-finished insulin is prepared here and then sent to Charlottenburg for finishing. The production of laboratory reagents is second only to that of E. Merck, Darmstadt. The factory is believed to employ 1,500 workers.

Bochum with a population of 320,000 is one of the chief centres of the coal and iron industry, there are important steelworks and approximately 30 per cent of the Ruhr coal is produced here. Like other areas of the Ruhr the Bochum district has an extensive rail transport system with major marshalling yards at Langendreer and Dahlhausen. There is only one important electricity power station in this area, but it is of outstanding significance in the Ruhr network. This is the 126 MW station at Hattingen. There are several local subsidiary stations of 10 to 20 MW at the pits. The principal industries are coal mining, with the usual accompaniment of coking plants and their by-products, as well as iron and steel manufacture. At Bochum are to be found the large steel and armaments works of the Bochumer Verein (Vereinigte Stahlwerke) viz: Werk Gusstahlfabrik Werk Hontrop Werk Stahlindustrie Werk Weitmar as well as large engineering concerns. Oil is represented at Bochum by three tar distillation plants. There are smaller concentrations at Hattingen which has a population of 16,000 and contains a large steel plant, and at Langendreer.</p><list type="industries_infrastructure">

</population></placeName><p>Braunschweig, or Brunswick, on the river Oker, is the chief town of the State of the same name. It is situated on the fertile plain North of the Hartz Mountains and lies in the rich agricultural district of the Aller basin. The town is the principal marketing centre for the corn, sugar, vegetables and cattle of the area. The inner town is a well preserved survival of mediaeval days with many half-timbered houses. In early years Brunswick was a road junction on the trade route from Hamburg to Southern Germany and the town still retains its importance as a communications centre. It is on the railway midway between Magdeburg and Hannover with through connections to the Baltic and North Sea coast. Brunswick is linked by its harbour with the Mittelland Canal and thus has direct access to Germany's extensive inland waterways system. Formerly Brunswick's chief speciality was the preservation of foodstuffs and it is still an important supplier of the armed forces. <pb n="92" xml:id="page_92" facs="https://gutenberg-capture.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454232"/>The town has, however, now become of outstanding importance owing to the development of the aircraft and engineering industries. There are two large aircraft works in the town and two equally important works in the outlying districts of Querum and Waggum which lie within the administrative area. The industrial plants in Brunswick are mainly grouped in the southern quarter of the town in the neighbourhood of the railway yards and in the northern outskirts where there are several factories chiefly engaged in engineering. Shortly before the war the Hermann Göring concern erected a huge steel plant in the village of Hallendorf some 8 miles South West of Brunswick. This plant is one of the largest of its kind in the Reich and the industrial importance of Brunswick increased still further after its construction. For this reason these works are included in the targets listed below, although they are situated well beyond the boundaries of the town. The plant is extensively provided with road and rail communications linking it through Brunswick with other parts of Germany.</p><list type="industries_infrastructure">

The larger portion, on the left bank, includes the old part of the town. Breslau is the chief industrial centre of eastern Germany and is important owing to its position near the Silesian coal and ore fields. Among its industries are engineering works including the largest railway wagon manufacturers in the Reich, non-ferrous metal plants dealing chiefly with aluminium, aircraft works textile factories, and iron foundries. There are also in this district numerous small chemical factories, grain silos and flour mills. In order to facilitate transportation of coal from Silesia to Stettin and other parts of Germany, a canal known as the Breitenbachfahrt canal has been built which, in conjunction with the Alte Oder, by-passes the northern outskirts of the city and joins the Oder some two miles to the N.W.</p><list type="industries_infrastructure">

</population></placeName><p>The city of Danzig is on the river Vistula four miles from its mouth. From Danzig the Vistula flows northwards into the Baltic. Neufahrwasser the outer port of Danzig, is on the left bank close to the mouth of the river. In the northern quarter of Danzig proper, along the banks of the Vistula, are the important Schichau and Danziger Werft ship building yards. A cut-off in the river Vistula, known as the Kaiserhafen and about 1 1/2 miles long, stretches from the Eastern end of the ship building area across a bend in the Vistula, which it rejoins halfway between Danzig and the river mouth. The port of Danzig with its ship building and ship repairing activities, extends alongside these two waterways. The principal docks are in the Holm, the island formed by the Kaiserhafen and the bend of the Vistula. The town itself is divided by the stream of the Mottlau, a tributary of the Vistula. The north-west quarter constitutes the old city, with the main railway station on its western border. Two branches of the railway run from the main station west of the river Vistula to Neufahrwasser. A separate branch leaves the main line south of Danzig, encircles the city to the east, and serves the ports on the Kaiserhafen and the Holm Island as well as the railway repair shops on the right bank of the river. There are a number of large flour mills and various industries in the central city area and in the Niederstadt (the south-east quarter of the town), but it is as a ship and submarine building centre and as a naval and submarine base and arsenal that Danzig occupies a position of major importance.</p><list type="industries_infrastructure">

The map showing these boundaries is inserted at the end of this book. Dortmund with 550,000 inhabitants is the largest and most easterly town in the Ruhr. It is one of the chief centres of heavy industry in Germany and besides the large steel works is full of smaller concerns engaged in engineering of all kinds. The town's geographical position at the eastern extremity of the Ruhr, at the terminus of the Dortmund-Ems Canal, and in the centre of the Westphalian coal fields make it one of the busiest commercial centres in Germany. Although most of the marshalling yards in the Dortmund district are relatively small it is, next to Duisburg, the principal transport centre of the Ruhr particularly for through traffic to Central, North and Eastern Germany. The harbour situated at the terminus of the Dortmund-Ems Canal is of particular importance. Dortmund proper has only one power station which though large is of local importance only. Though there are several electric power plants in the vicinity of the city they are all privately owned concerns of comparatively small capacity and concerned only with the pits or works to which they belong. Gas is obtained from the Ruhr Gas Grid. There is an important V.E.W. station at Lünen with a capacity of 135 MW. There are two important industrial area in Dortmund. The first lies on the western side of the town and contains the very important harbour and two marshalling yards and south of the harbour, the large steel works of the Dortmund Hörder Hüttenverein A.G. The second area lies to the north east of the city and consists of the huge Hoesch steelworks, the Hoesch-Benzin G.m.b.H. Fischer-Tropsch plant and a marshalling yard which envelopes the north western side of the steelworks; also within this area is the Minister Stein concern with coke ovens, a by-products plant, and the power plant. Scattered throughout the town are numerous plants of secondary importance, the majority of which are engaged on engineering. At Hörde, to the south-east of Dortmund lies the Dortmund Hörder Hüttenverein, a subsidiary of the Vereinigte Stahlwerke A.G. and in its western portion the coking plant. In the north there are two important concerns; at Kamen a Fischer Tropsch plant, and west of Lünen on the Seiten Canal the Lippewerk of the Vereinigte Aluminium Werke A.G. Outside Dortmund there are numerous coke oven plants including "Hansa", the second largest in Germany, and several colliery concerns. To the extreme North West of the area is the ship-lift and the shaft lock at the junction of the Dortmund-Ems and Rhein-Herne canals.</p><list type="industries_infrastructure">

The left bank, with the Altstadt, or old town, as nucleus is the larger of the two parts; in it are found the commercial centre, the residential area and public buildings, and some industries, mainly in its S-Suburbs. Neustadt, on the right bank, and its suburbs contain industrial centres and administration. <pb n="155" xml:id="page_155" facs="https://gutenberg-capture.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454295"/>In peace time tobacco, chocolate and confectionery manufacture played a large part in Dresden's industrial activity; there are also a large number of light engineering works and makers of machinery which are now engaged on all kinds of war production, many of which are too small to be listed individually. Several important factories are making electric motors, precision and optical instruments and chemicals. The munitions workshops in the old arsenal occupy an extensive area to the North of Neustadt, along the railway to Klotsche, in the industrial region which extends past the aerodrome to the Dresdner Heide. In the Heide, a large heath, munitions are reported to be stored in quantities. Dresden is an important railway centre. The main connections between South and East Germany and the direct line from Berlin to Prague and Vienna pass through Dresden whence several branch lines lead to Leipzig and other parts of industrial Saxony. The river harbour is of considerable importance to the freight traffic of the Elbe. To the SW. of the town in the valley of the Weisseritz is the industrial town of Freital (dealt with under its own heading) and a small coal field which supplies the light industries that have been developed in Dresden. Along the northern bank of the Elbe between Dresden and Meissen are a number of industrial settlements which are outside the municipal area of Dresden. These have been dealt with separately under the town headings Radebeul, Coswig near Dresden, and Meissen.</p><list type="industries_infrastructure">

</population></placeName><p>The area covered lies in the Western extremity of the industrial district of the Ruhr. It is traversed from South to North by the Rhine, on the West of which is flat lightly-wooded country with scattered villages and small towns, lying at the general level of 75 to 100 feet above sea level. On the East of the Rhine the country is much more thickly populated and rises eastwards to about 200 feet, except in the gap through which run the River Ruhr and the Rhine-Herne canal. To the North and South are extensive forests. Duisburg is by far the largest town in this district with a population of nearly 440,000 (including Hamborn). It lies on both sides of the mouth of the river Ruhr and includes the townships of Ruhrort, Hamborn, Wanheimerort, Huckingen, Rheinhausen, Wedau, Grossenbaum and Dinslaken. Duisburg owes its industrial importance and prosperity to the presence, in its immediate vicinity, of hard coal in very considerable quantities. This has accounted for the development of iron and steel, heavy engineering, and other industries and brought about the necessity for construction and repeated expansion of the Duisburg-Ruhrort Harbour situated at the mouth of the river Ruhr. Duisburg's situation at the confluences of the rivers Rhine and Ruhr and in the centre of the western concentration of the Ruhr industrial area gives it great importance from the point of view of transportation. Its main claim to fame is that it is here more than anywhere else in the Ruhr or Rhineland that the transfer of goods from rail to water or water to rail takes place, and it is this factor that has made Duisburg the greatest inland waterway harbour in Europe. The railway network at Duisburg has been constructed primarily to provide ample facilities to deal with the rail traffic originating from, or destined for the waterways; this function is fulfilled by the extensive marshalling yards at Ruhrort Hafen Neu Schultenhof, which handled about 14 million tons of traffic annually before the w ar. A second - and scarcely less important - function of the system is to accommodate the North-South and the West-East flow of land traffic; this is achieved by the marshalling yards at Duisburg main station, and, amongst others, those at Oberhausen West in the North-East (see under "Oberhausen"), at Wedau to the South-East, and at Hohenbudberg on the left bank of the river Rhine (see under "Uerdingen"). In addition, Duisburg lies on the Rhine-Herne Canal, which leaves the Rhine at this point and joins the Dortmund-Ems Canal near Datteln and thus links Duisburg by waterway with the North Sea at Emden and the Mittelland Canal at Bevergern. There are two harbours to deal with the waterborne traffic, which consists in the main of coal, coke, and finished iron and steel goods (outwards): iron-ore, grain and timber (inwards); the harbours are also important for storage reasons. There are no particularly important electrical power plants in this area. The Town Power Station has a capacity not exceeding 50 MW and is connected to the main R.W.E grid system through Brauweiler. <pb n="163" xml:id="page_163" facs="https://gutenberg-capture.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454303"/>The Town Gasworks are adjacent to the Power Station. The principal industries are mining, the conversion of coal into coke, gas and the usual by-products, iron and steel manufacture, and heavy engineering. The coal and iron and steel industry is almost entirely in the hands of Vereinigte Stahlwerke A.G. and its subsidiary companies, the Gelsenkirchener Bergwerke A.G. which operates some of the largest pits and coke ovens, the August Thyssen Hütte A.G. which operates four great blast furnace plants, the Deutsche Eisenwerk A.G. which is responsible for blast furnaces at Hamborn, the Deutsche Röhrenwerk A.G. and Bandeisenwalzwerke A.G. (which controls the rolling mills at Dinslaken) and the Eisenwerk Wanheim G.m.b.H. These numerous and highly important industrial plants are spread over an extensive area stretching from the South West mainly along the East bank of the Rhine to Dinslaken in the North and extending East to the boundaries with Oberhausen and Mulheim.</p><list type="industries_infrastructure">

The harbour forms the intermediary between railways and waterways, its primary activity being the dispatch of a large portion of the output of the Westphalian coal fields. There are numerous ore depots, and the harbour also handles grain. By its position Duisburg-Ruhrort has become a natural junction for the Lower Rhine and Westphalian railways.

In the last war the Düneberg factory was Germany's largest producer of nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine. Most of this production was sent to the Krümmel factory for the manufacture of powder. There has been very little ground information on the activities of this plant during the present war, and there is no air cover. Such reports as have been received suggest that it has attained at least its former activity, and it is probable that it bears the same relation to the Krümmel plant as formerly. On this basis it may be assumed that the nitrocellulose production is upwards of 36,000 tons per annum, but it would be difficult to guess the nitroglycerine or diglycoldinitrate production, since it is unlikely that Germany will have concentrated her production of this class of explosive to so great a degree as in the last war, and at least one new factory engaged in this production has been identified.</p></item>

In the peace years this factory was allowed to continue operations, manufacturing small quantities of nitroglycerine (probably for mining explosives); it also introduced, strangely enough, the production of T.N.T. on a small scale (a little over 1,000 tons a year), and engaged in the production of nitrocellulose for celluloid and synthetic fibre production. There is very little information regarding the activities of the Krümmel factory in the present war, but it is clear that a very large labour force is now employed. Apart, however, from a report that its nitroglycerine or diglycol dinitrate production approaches 5,000 tons per annum, which is roughly the same as the production in the last war, there is little information as to its output. On the basis of the nitroglycerine or diglycoldinitrate output, it seems likely that this factory has achieved at least its last war importance, and may have considerably exceeded it. This would indicate a nitrocellulose output of about 20,000 tons a year. The factory lies on the banks of the Elbe, east of the village of Geesthacht. There is also probably a large propellant powder plant on this site</p></item>

The city of Neuss on the western bank of the Rhine is to be found under its own heading and is not included in Düsseldorf. The total population for this area is 559,000 (1940). The city of Düsseldorf has a population of 528,000 (1940) and is the leading commercial city of western Germany. Situated on the eastern bank of the Rhine, it has exceptionally good transport facilities both by river and rail. It is furthermore Germany's third largest inland port, and therefore of particular importance as a transport centre. During and after the last war, Düsseldorf developed considerably and so far as the production of armaments and general engineering is concerned, it is as important as Essen or Duisburg. In addition Düsseldorf is the seat of the General Administrative Departments of practically all the important iron and steel, heavy engineering, and armament concerns in Rhine and Ruhr districts. The distribution of industry in the Düsseldorf area may be said to lie in 4 main areas:- i) The eastern and southern part of the city proper. This is a highly concentrated area containing large engineering works, machine tool makers, wire-drawing plant, and the municipal gas and electricity works. ii) The northern suburb of Derendorf and townships of Rath and Ratingen. Here are to be found extensive marshalling yards and highly important armament manufacturers. iii) The harbour area on the Rhine to the southwest of the city with docks, storage and engineering firms. iv) South of Düsseldorf at Reisholz and Benrath. Engineering and chemical works, oil refinery and storage, electricity works, electric resistance wire works, lead and zinc fabricators are all grouped in this area which extends in a south-westerly and north-easterly direction and embraces the townships of Nievenheim and Erkrath.</p><list type="industries_infrastructure">

These two plants are probably large consumers of the electrical output of the station. In 1938 the existing turbo-generator sets had a total capacity of 75 MW. It is believed that there were two or three units with a total capacity of 15 MW and three or four units with a capacity of 15-20 MW each. In 1939 two additional sets each of 20 MW capacity were installed by the A.E.G.

Local supplies are given to the adjacent works mentioned above, and to the industrial area of Dusseldorf. There is a 110 kV outdoor substation in which at least 2 transformers are installed. Two 110 kV lines leave the station. One goes to the Erftwerk (Grevenbroich) aluminium plant of the VAWAG and crosses the Rhine immediately on leaving the station.

It is believed that with the installation of new equipment and plant, the productive capacity of the Eisleben/Mansfeld plants had by the outbreak of war been stepped up to as much as 30,000 tons of copper per annum out of a total German production of new copper of 33,500 tons per annum. The Eisleben/Mansfeld production is distributed over tne following works, the individual output of which is not known:- a) Mansfeldscher Kupferschiefer Bergbau A.G. at Mansfeld near Eisleben. b) Kur-Hessische Kupferbergbau G.m.b.H. Hosel near Mansfeld. c) Studiengesellschaft Deutscher Kupferbergbau G.m.b.H. at Liedersdorf and Sotterhausen near Mansfeld. The Mansfeld company operates two mines at Eisleben and others nearby are at Krughütte and Clothildenschacht. The company has a smelting plant at Eisleben and a smelting plant and refineries at Hettstedt with a total capacity of 30,000 tons per annum of which 25,000 tons is electrolytic refining and 5,000 tons fire refining. The smelting plant at Eisleben treats only ores produced from the Mansfeld mines and has no provision for refining. The smelters and refineries at Hettstedt treat the blister copper from Eisleben, copper ores and mattes from Mansfeld, Liedersdorf, and Hasel as well as copper scrap. The Mansfeld plants at Eisleben and Hettstedt fabricate virtually the whole production of the Mansfeld refineries. They have an output of approximately 25,000 tons per annum of copper sheet and wire, the bulk being in the form of copper sheet</p></item>

</population></placeName><p>Emden, situated on the right bank of the Ems estuary opposite the Dutch coast, is the most westerly of the German North Sea ports and the nearest to England. The surrounding country is flat, and low-lying, intersected by canals and almost entirely devoted to agriculture. Apart from its harbour and associated industry, Emden and the surrounding district is not industrially significant. Its position, however, as a terminus of the Dortmund-Ems Canal and the Ems-Jade Canal connecting Emden with Wilhelmshaven makes it a valuable service port for the Ruhr, particularly in the handling of Swedish iron ore for which it is specially equipped. It is also important as a naval station, a base for mine-layers and mine-sweepers, and for its facilities for shipbuilding and ship repairs. There are four main harbours, the Outer Harbour, the Inner Harbour, the New Inner Harbour, and the Industry Harbour. Of these, only the Outer Harbour is tidal, the others being entered from the sea, either via the look at the entrance to the New Inner Harbour, or through that at the northern end of the Outer Harbour. The Outer Harbour is capable of accommodating the largest sea-going vessels at its quays. The New Inner Harbour, in which is handled a large proportion of Emden's traffic, is reached by the large ocean lock (260 m. long by 40 m. wide). On the south of this harbour is the Ore and Iron Quay; coal and coke are also dealt with at this quay. Adjacent to the New Inner Harbour on the north is the Industry Harbour with the Nordseewerke shipyard and a briquette factory. The harbour equipment includes a great variety of cranes, and good railway connections to the quays enable loading to be effected direct from truck to ship without the need of intermediate storage. Emden is supplied with electricity on the grid system. A grid and transformer station is situated at the eastern extremity of the Industry Harbour. A small power plant on the east quay of the Inner Harbour, at its southern end, supplies power for dock installations. Emden has no important local industries. Its value lies rather in its trade, which causes the port to rank high among German seaports. It is the import and export harbour for bulk goods to and from the eastern and central Ruhr, notably serving this district with supplies <pb n="201" xml:id="page_201" facs="https://gutenberg-capture.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454341"/>of iron ore from Sweden. There is also an active trade in agricultural produce, cattle, timber, coal and coke, while it was in peace time an important base for the deep sea fishing fleet. On the east quay of the Outer Harbour are large grain warehouses and a silo. Submarines and small surface craft are constructed at the Nordseewerke.</p><list type="industries_infrastructure">

The largest of these is the Ocean Lock at the entrance to the Neuer-Binnen-Hafen which is 260 metres long by 40 metres wide.

</population></placeName><p>General The area covered by this report is in the central part of the Ruhr; it consists of undulating country varying from 100 to 400 ft. above sea level with some wooded area to the north and south. Essen includes within its boundaries a number of sprawling suburbs with a total population of 670,000; the original town and surrounding villages have long since outgrown their boundaries and industrialization has given the area a character not unlike that of an English mining district. Essen is the great armaments centre of the Ruhr. Its reputation as Germany's greatest armaments arsenal ("Die Waffenschmiede des Reichs" as the Germans call it) originates from World War I in the course of which the famous Friedrich Krupp works expanded on a scale unprecedented in history. In 1917/18 a peak figure of over 150,000 workers were employed by the Fr. Krupp A.G. undertaking, some 80,000 of whom worked at the main plant at Essen. But whereas Krupp throughout the last war remained the principal producer of armaments in the Reich it had, up to to the outbreak of World War II, to a great extent lost its dominating position in the field of German arma ents manufacture, partly as a result of the complete reorganisation of the works after the collapse of Germany's war machine in 1918 and in accordance with which several large departments were successfully switched over to commercial commodities such as locomotives, lorries, Diesel engines for heavy road transport, small ships diesels, forged drums for high-pressure boilers, wheels and axles for locomotives, railway trucks and wagons etc., and also due to the fact that other important armaments producers, particularly the Rheinmetall Borsig works at Derendorf near Düsseldorf (20 miles S.W. of Essen), Germany's second largest armaments producers in the last war, have been considerably extended and today are probably of equal importance as armaments makers. There is no doubt that the main Essen works of Friedrich Krupp A.G. remained the largest individual armaments and heavy engineering plant in the Reich, but instead of being one vast arms producing centre, as was the case during the last war, it became rather a combination of factories producing a wide range of materials and articles, many of which, although of the utmost importance to Germany's war effort, are not of an armament nature. However, Krupp remains the principal if not only producer in Germany of heavy naval, coastal defence and railway guns.<pb
n="208" facs="https://gutenberg-capture.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454348"/>It was estimated in 1942 that the total number of workers and employees operating in the various Krupp works was 175,000. This number was divided roughly as follows:- Armaments sections of the main works at Essen 35,000 Heavy engineering sections of the main works at Essen. 40,000 Krupp Gruson Works at Magdeburg (armaments and heavy engineering) 35,000 Coal mines, iron-ore mines, coke-oven plants, synthetic oil plants, etc. situated at various places in Western Germany 18,000 Friedrich Alfred Hütte steelworks near Duisburg 12,000 Friedrich Krupp iron and steel works, Essen, (situated several miles West of the main works). 5,000 Krupp Germania Werft, Kiel. (shipbuilding yards) 10,000 Administrative staff at the various works, holding and financing companies, distribution centres, trading companies, etc. 20,000 175,000 At the southern boundary of the district is the River Ruhr, which is navigable by smaller barges from Duisburg to Witten, east of Essen. Across the centre of the area run the Emscher Canal and the Rhine-Herne Canal. The former is used for drainage purposes and runs from Walsum on the Rhine to Dortmund. The latter is an important connecting link between the Rhine and the Dortmund-Ems Canal; along it passes traffic which has come down the Rhine and its tributaries to Duisburg-Ruhrort and by its junction with the Dortmund-Ems Canal the traffic passes on to the Mittelland Canal and so to the great towns of north Germany. Damage to any of the three locks would therefore have a serious effect on the industrial life of a great part of the country. It will be observed that many of the important industries of this district lie close to or on the canal harbours. The area is provided with large marshalling yards and a network of railways, so interconnected that it is difficult to pick out those of outstanding importance. It is probable, however, that the Osterfeld Marshalling Yard (see under "Oberhausen") handles a large proportion of the traffic between Duisburg and northern Germany. The other targetted yards in this area probably serve mainly as local yards. The most important electrical objective in this area is the Essen-Karnap 220 MW. R.W.E. electric power station situated a few miles north of Essen. This is the most important power plant in the Ruhr industrial area. There is also a 45 MW. R.W.E. station in Essen
itself.<pb n="209" xml:id="page_209" facs="https://gutenberg-capture.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454349"/>Although it is hardly possible to distinguish any areas as industrially more important than others, because any attempt to do so would leave out of account some very important targets, it may be said that the principal group of targets covered by this report lie within the area of Essen proper, and stretch north-westwards from Essen-town to the Rhine-Herne Canal. It includes the steel works of Friedrich Krupp A.G. as well as the vast arms, locomotives and general engineering works of that firm, besides large coal mines and coke-oven plants; the zinc smelters of A.G. des Altenbergs für Bergbau and Zinkhüttenbetrieb at Borbeck; the plastics works of Presswerk A.G.; the very important chemicals and non-ferrous metals works Th. Goldschmidt A.G. (now inactive, see under Non-Ferrous Metals); and finally the important railway traffic centre Essen-Verschiebebahnhof. During 1943, the town of Essen was largely devastated. Extremely severe damage was inflicted on the Friedrich Krupp works and it was thought that by the end of July 1943, output had been reduced to one third of capacity. Since then, some reconstruction has taken place, and by the end of 1943 output was reckoned at 40% of pre-raid capacity. The works of Theodore Goldschmidt A.G. were also severely damaged and are believed to be inactive (see under Non-ferrous Metals).</p><list type="industries_infrastructure">

ESSEN</label> <measure><num>(1)</num><unit unitRef="#priority-rating">priority</unit></measure><p>The engineering and armaments works of FRIEDRICH KRUPP are situated in the Western half of ESSEN itself. These works are built on a site of more than 2,150 acres, of which nearly 300 are covered by factories and workshops, the area being approximately 2 miles long and a mile wide. There are 11 open-hearth furnaces, having an estimated annual capacity of 400,000 tons of crude steel. Pig iron and crude steel is also sent to these works from the BORBECK iron and steel works. Electric steel is also made. In the S.W. area of the plant, lies the section producing WIDIA (tungsten-carbide), which is used for the tips of tools, cores of armour-piercing ammunition, etc. The finished and semi-finished products of these tremendous works cover an extensive range, only the more important of which can be mentioned here. The northern part of the works contains one of the largest locomotive shops in Europe, which consists of a simple building having 19 parallel bays, with a total floor space of over 88,000 square yards. There is a tyre-rolling plant covering 34,000 square yards, which has an annual production estimated at 315,000 tyres and 120,000 wheel centres. The numerous forges are capable of producing the largest forgings for guns, including the heavier naval types, parts for turbines and locomotives, and also smaller forgings such as components for motor vehicles and aircraft. The hammer and forging shops contain 120 steam hammers and 11 steam hydraulic presses. In the largest forging shop there are presses of 200, 400, and 500 tons capacity, and one large press of 1,500 tons capacity, which is served by two 400-ton cranes manipulating the ingots, while another two 100-ton cranes handle the necessary tools. Amongst the many rolling mills are those containing drawing and flanging presses of various capacity, aggregating over 8,000 tons. There are several foundries for iron, malleable iron, rustless and heat-resisting castings and non-ferrous castings in brass, bronzes, and aluminium. Besides these, there are numerous other shops engaged on general engineering. The number of employees engaged in the heavy engineering and armaments section of the works was estimated at 75,000 in 1942. The harbour on the RHEIN-HERNE canal is described under "Transportation", the power station and waterworks under "Public Utilities", the coking plants and collieries under "Solid Fuels", and the Borbeck plant under "Iron and Steel". A note on Krupp's generally is to be found in the introduction to "ESSEN", which also covers the question of bomb damage.</p></item>

It was chosen as the site of the Peoples Car factory - Volkswagenwerke - and developed rapidly and simultaneously with the erection of the great automobile works. Since 1940 a number of workers' colonies have been built in the vicinity of the works mainly for the purpose of housing prisoners of war, and labour imported from occupied countries.</p><list type="industries_infrastructure">

At the outbreak of the war the Fallersleben plant was still under construction, and it has never been utilized for its original purpose. However, much of the original installations are now employed on the large scale manufacture of a military version of the "Peoples' Car" in both the normal and amphibious types. Another major activity of this works is believed to be the repair of aircraft fuselages and possibly also the manufacture of components. Ground intelligence suggests that at least one section of the works is engaged on the machining of bombs up to 2,000 kg. It is believed that approximately 15,000 workers are employed at Fallersleben.</p></item>

</population></placeName><p>General The area covered hereunder includes the town of Frankfort/Main proper as well as the outlying suburbs Höchst, Griesheim, Nied, Rödelheim, Heddernheim, Praunheim, Fechenheim, Mainkur, Oherrad, and Niederrad, together convering an area of 49,000 acres. The nearby town of Offenbach/Main, lying within the borders of the province Hesse, is dealt with separately under Offenbach. Frankfurt is the commercial, industrial and cultural metropolis of the Upper Rhineland, an important transport centre, and since 1933 also important as a military training centre with a large number of new and extensive barracks situated around the Friedberger Warte in the suburb Praunheim to the North of the town. Communications Frankfort is an important railway junction on the lines from Berlin to Basle, from Cologne via Nurnberg to Vienna, from Hamburg and Kassel and from Dresden and Leipzig to France and Switzerland. The river Main is sufficiently dredged to take heavy barge traffic several hundred miles up the river, thus making Frankfort one of the leading inland ports on the Rhein-Main-Danube canal route. Industry The largest industrial plants in the area are the chemical works of I.G. Farbenindustrie at Höchst and Griesheim-on-Main some 5 miles west of the town. Within the built-up outskirts of Frankfort proper are the Adler Werke, important manufacturers of motor vehicles and military transport, and immediately adjacent the large works of Alfred Teves which in pre-war days produced the well known ATE refrigerators and were also the leading manufacturers in Germany of Lockhead brakes and piston rings. The Teves works have been enlarged considerably during the last four years and have replaced refrigerator production by the manufacture of retractable undercarriages for aircraft and a variety of other aircraft components. At Heddernheim, a North-Eastern suburb, is the important non-ferrous metal works of the Vereinigte Deutsche Metallwerke formerly well known under the name of Heddernheimer Kupferwerke. To the war industry this plant is of particular importance as a prominent producer of air-screws. <pb n="228" xml:id="page_228" facs="https://gutenberg-capture.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454368"/>Many other factories, the production of which is solely confined to the supply of Germany's war machine, are located within this town. Among these special war products are aircraft and motor-vehicle instruments, detonating apparatus for naval mines, precision measuring instruments, special electrical gear, including range finding apparatus for the Navy, small-arms-munition and so forth. Frankfort has also large grain stores, flour mills, power stations, and oil storage plants. In addition to the huge chemical plants at Griesheim and Höchst, more than twenty other chemical factories are located, within, or in the immediate vicinity of the town. Frankfort is often referred to as the centre of Germany's chemical industry. This is partly due to the fact that the I.G., Germany's great chemical trust, have their administrative headquarters here in the so-called I.G. Hochhaus. This is a very modern office building in the western section of the town where more than 3,000 officials, are housed. In addition Frankfort is also the headquarters of the "Degussa" Chemical concern (Deutsche Gold and Silber Scheideanstalt) another imortant chemical trust and of the Metallgesellschaft A.G., a large chemical and non-ferrous metal concern. Principal Industrial Areas Within or immediately adjacent to the built-up area of the town are a number of industrial targets of primary importance situated in two distinctly separate areas:- Area "A" - Stretching South from the Main Goods Yards to the River Main includes such important targets as the Adler Werke A.G. (vorm. Hch. Kleyer), building M.T., A.F.V.'s and A.F.V. components, M.G. and small-arms components; Fritz Gerner, making components for Messerschmitt fighters; Alfred Teves making M.T. and a/c components, piston rings, brakes, propellor shafts, valves etc., V.D.O. Tachometer making a/c and M.T. instruments; Hartmann und Braun making a/c and other instruments, gauges, etc.; and a number of small engineering works, as well as Peters-Union (Continental) making tyres and tubes and other rubber manufactures; as well as the three factories of I. and C.A. Schneider, largest slipper manufacturers in Germany. Also within area "A" is an important 58 MW power station. Area "B" - which stretches from the Marshalling Yard-Ost to the river Main, includes the East Harbour, Gaswerk-Ost; Messer and Co., making welding machines; a petroleum receiving depot, flour mills and grain storage plants; and the large works of Voigt and Häffner A.G. making switchgear and special electrical equipment. Roughly 1/2 mile North-West of area "B" is the important plant of Naxos Union one of the leading German makers of grinding wheels.</p><list type="industries_infrastructure">

(Heddernheimer Kupferwerke) Heddernheim</label> <measure><num>(1+)</num><unit unitRef="#priority-rating">priority</unit></measure><p>This target is the airscrew, aircraft components and non-ferrous metal works of the Vereinigte Deutsche Metallwerke A.G. (V.D.M.) (Heddernheimer Kupferwerke) situated about 1/2 mile North of Heddernheim, a suburb of Frankfort/Main and about 4 miles North by West of the centre of that city. It occupies a triangular area of about 600 acres on the West side of the marshy ground which here forms a broad belt to the West of the river Nidda. This works has been considerably expanded in recent years, particularly since 1939, and the total number of workers employed is now thought to be not far short of 10,000. The V.D.M. was originally engaged mainly in the production and fabrication of copper and copper alloys and produced sheets, strips, rods, sections, castings, stampings, extensions, tubes and wire in copper, bronze, brass, copper-nickel etc. These products included many specialities such as locomotive boiler tubes, condenser tubes, vessels for chemical plant, welding electrodes, bearing alloys, detonators etc. and also fine copper wire for use in electrical apparatus. <pb n="233" xml:id="page_233" facs="https://gutenberg-capture.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454373"/>Owing to its great experience in the working of non-ferrous metals it was inevitable that when the light alloy industry began to be developed V.D.M. should play a leading part in it. Products In addition to its production of copper and copper-alloy semi-products Heddernheim is believed to be producing a large range of semi-products in light alloys for use by aircraft manufacturers and other armament manufacturers and an important range of specialized aircraft components. The semi-products include sheet and strip, tubes, pressings and stampings, extruded sections, and castings. The special aircraft components are known to include airscrew hubs and all metal variable pitch airscrews, retractable undercarriages and oleo legs, wheels, shock-absorber devices and control gear. Examples of V.D.M. products in military equipment are also known, and the company is almost certainly also making light-metal fittings for submarines. Capacity An up-to-date estimate for the capacity of the Heddernheim works is difficult to produce, especially owing to the difficulty of estimating the extent to which copper-fabricating plant in this and other works has been turned over to working on light alloys. It is known that Heddernheim had one of the best rolling mills in Germany for aluminium sheet and strip and produced about 6,000 tons per year which was about 10% of the country's total former output. Heddernheim's capacity for the production of extruded sections is believed to have been about 4,000 tons per year or about 25% of the total German capacity. At least 50% of the total output was required by the aircraft industry. It is also (after I.G. Bitterfeld) one of the two most important producers of wrought magnesium-alloy products. The output of complete airscrews at Heddernheim at the present time is believed to be slightly above 30% of the total German production. <pb n="234" xml:id="page_234" facs="https://gutenberg-capture.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454374"/>Deutsche Gold- and Silber Scheideanstalt (see under Chemicals)</p></item>

In August 1943, according to a well-informed source, this unit was the centre for the development of specialised Dornier types such as the Do. 217M, equipped with DB. 603 engines, and a high altitude reconnaissance type. At that time it was assembling 20 Do. 217s per month. Since then all <pb n="249" xml:id="page_249" facs="https://gutenberg-capture.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454389"/>evidence points to decreased activity and recent cover of the field shows only 20 to 25 aircraft, including a number of modified types and experimental models. It is doubtful if new Do. 217s are being produced here at present, though repairs and the installation of special equipment may be continuing on a small scale. Interest in this plant as a target derives mainly from (1) reports that the Dornier organization and this unit in particular are tooling up for production of F.W. 190s, (2) reports that certain Dornier plants in the Friedrichshafen area are engaged in production of the Peenemünde 20, and (3) the possibility that this plant may resume production of Do. 217 fighters in an effort to make up losses in twin-engine fighters resulting from recent attacks on German aircraft factories and operating attrition of the GAF.</p></item>
<item><label>Dornier Werke G.m.b.H. Manzell</label> <measure><num>(2)</num><unit unitRef="#priority-rating">priority</unit></measure><p>This plant is the parent works of the Dornier complex at Friedrichshafen. A year ago it was engaged in experimentation and development of new Dornier types, the production of Do 217 components for assembly at Allmansweiler/Löwenthal, and possibly some seaplane development and assembly. The nature and scale of the plant's activities at present can only be inferred from the accumulation of existing ground reports. This intelligence is summarized below: i) There is no evidence that seaplanes are being assembled, though the plant probably serves as a seaplane base and may continue to do experimental work on Dornier seaplanes. ii) Manufacture of Do 217 components may be continuing on a reduced scale. The total output of Do 217s in all three complexes is not believed at present to exceed 20 per month. <pb n="250" xml:id="page_250" facs="https://gutenberg-capture.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454390"/>iii) With other plants in the Friedrichshafen district, Dorner at Manzell may contribute in some way to the production of pilotless aircraft. Intelligence is not conclusive on this point but points strongly to some type of involvement. iv) This plant may be tooling up for the manufacture of FW 190 components since it is reported that Dornier is to undertake production of this aircraft and Friedrichshafen has been specifically mentioned.</p></item>

Two main railway lines coming from the N. and W. through Würzburg and Bamberg respectively converge at Fürth before entering Nürnberg. There are two airfields, the larger of which is roughly two miles N.N.W. of the town and the second, where an important aircraft factory is situated, is 1 mile W. of the town. The most important of Fürth's present industries is the aircraft factory mentioned below, but the town contains a great number of factories, mostly of small individual size, with a big range of products. Glass mirrors are one of Fürth's main specialities. The Bayerische Spiegelglasfabriken A.G. is the largest of several such mirror manufacturers. Toys, spectacles, and furniture are made by a great number of firms. The gold-beating, bronze paint, and metal foil industries have many factories in Fürth and there are 5 large-scale breweries which, in peace time, did a big export trade.</p><list type="industries_infrastructure">

In the vicinity are smelters producing lead, zinc and copper. In the year 1937 the district contributed 41% of the total German lead production. The chief producer of lead in the district is the Rammelsberg mine, situated 2 miles south of Goslar, which, when working at full pressure, yields an output of lead concentrates amounting to about 30% of Germany's total production; the copper output of this mine, though principally a producer of lead and zinc, is also considerable. The mining company owning the mine, the Unterharzer Berg- u. Hüttenwerke, is a subsidiary of the Preussische Bergwerks- u. Hütten A.G. which company operates other metal mines in Klausthal and Lautenthal through subsidiary undertakings. The mines are scatterd among the hills, at Harlingerode to the East, Rammelsberg to the South, and at Klausthal and Lautenthal to the south west. The latter two areas are referred to under their own names. There are a number of small industries such as textile fancy goods, a chemical factory which is mentioned below, and a factory making office requisites which is some note in that branch. At Langelsheim 5 miles to the west is a factory making chemical products.</p><list type="industries_infrastructure">

The firms' title is misleading as the larger part of this plant if not its entirety is devoted to the manufacture of aircraft components and the assembly of fighter aircraft their connection with which dates from the 1914-18 war when the Gotha aeroplane was one of the chief German types. The activity of the Gotha plant has expanded more or less steadily since 1934 when some 3,000 workers were employed. By 1937 that number had increased to 4,000 and by 1939 some 4,500 were employed. Further expansion has occured in the course of this war. Prior to the war a large proportion of this <pb n="282" xml:id="page_282" facs="https://gutenberg-capture.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454422"/>this plant was devoted to the manufacture of narrow gauge locomotives, trailers and other heavy vehicles. During the early part of this war these activities were continued on a smaller scale and some of the capacity of the plant that became available is believed to have been employed on the manufacture of tank transport vehicles. There is reason to believe that most of these activities were dragged in the course of the last two to three years and that the plant was practically completely converted for the manufacture of aircraft components and the assembly of aircraft particularly the erection of components and the final assembly of Me. 110. Prior to a raid by the U.S. Air Force in February, 1944, in the course of which the works was very severely damaged, its estimated output was 75 Me. 110 per month. The works also supplies wing sections, fuselage parts etc. to Brunswick and Augsburg.</p></item>

It is on the main line from Berlin to Frankfort/Main and together with Leipzig which is 20 miles to the S.E. it forms the focal point of the railway system of industrial Saxony. Apart from the railway workshops and the aeroplane factory described below, the industry of Halle is mostly in the hands of small firms and includes engineering works, metal foundries, printing and furniture making. To the North and South of the town are large brown-coal deposits and the firms exploiting these have their head offices in Halle. Halle is a compact and densely populated town. A large proportion of the population work in or in connection with the outlying districts. There are two highly important works, within 10 miles of and to the South of Halle: the Leuna works at Merseburg and the Buna works at Schkopau. At Teutschenthal 10 miles to the West there is a notable non-ferrous metal works. All these are dealt with under their separate headings. The small suburb of Ammendorf, 1 mile to the South of Halle, is not inside the administrative area, and is dealt with separately.</p><list type="industries_infrastructure">

</population></placeName><p>Hamburg has, for a considerable time, held the first place among the ports of Continental Europe, and has risen to be the third largest shipping centre in the world. This development is due not only to the vast extensions and the modernisations of its Free Port, but also to the exceptional facilities offered for storing and manipulating goods in bond - notably colonial produce and oil. Hamburg's sea-going merchant fleet counted, on January 1st 1937, 1,538 ships, with an aggregate of 2,275,000 G.R.T. During 1938, the port's incoming and outgoing traffic each amounted to 20 1/2 million tons net, while imports of goods reached 18 million tons, and exports 7 1/4 million tons. The old port was confined to the northern side of the River Elbe, but the really important and modern port has developed entirely along the river's southern bank. This main port area falls roughly into two sections (a) centred on the HANSA-HAFEN and (b) on the ODER-HAFEN, which provide accommodation for the chief overseas liners. In the new port too are the big shipbuilding yards, and numerous engineering and armament works. Besides plants connected with shipbuilding, the port area accommodates other big engineering works and roughly half of Hamburg's very important oil-storage installations (total pre-war capacity over 1,300,000 tons), oil-crushing mills, non-ferrous metal works, several aircraft and aircraft component factories including important airscrew works, as well as grain, and other foodstuff factories and storage centres. Next in importance to the port proper comes the Harburg-Wilhelmsburg district, to the South, where big vegetable-oil plants, other food processing factories, the huge grain and produce warehouses, chemical works and a well-known rubber tyre factory are located. Altona, on the northern bank of the Elbe, specialises more in light metal industries, including castings for aero-engines, but has also several other important industries and food storage installations. In the inner port (Binnenhafen-Sandtorhafen), also on the Altona side of the port, lies the very congested chief warehouse area. A net of railway tracks connects this area with the Main Station of Hamburg. <pb n="304" xml:id="page_304" facs="https://gutenberg-capture.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454444"/>One of the striking features of the central residential and commercial area of the city proper is the Alster Lake (actually a widened arm of the River Elbe). The major (northern) portion of this lake is known as the Aussen-Alster (outer Alster), and the much smaller and narrower southern tip is called the Binnen-Alster (inner Alster). Crossing this portion is the Lombard bridge, which forms (or formed) the sole connecting link between the business district of the city and the large residential district to the West. The whole of the Binnen-Alster is now camouflaged. Apart from the industries and warehouses located in the port area, Altona, and Harburg-Wilhelmsburg, there are numerous works, storage installations, etc. scattered about other districts of greater Hamburg. The railway system includes nine major complexes of goods stations, marshalling yards, and sidings. Of these, five are situated in, or adjacent to, the port area. A sixth lies to the South of the Süder-Elbe (outside the port proper) stretching for about 7 km., roughly North to South, along the southern outskirts of Harburg, between the Gutmoor and the Wilstorf-Ronneburg district. The remaining three goods yards etc. are in the Altona, Stellingen, and Barmbeck areas. All are connected with the Hamburg Central Station. At the end of 1936 the railway-net measured 138 km., the tramway system 232 km.</p><list type="industries_infrastructure">

This refinery was also engaged in recovering metal from the increased nickel coinage minted in 1933 when the coinage was recalled in 1939. Since there is no great reservoir of nickel scrap to be drawn upon in Germany, it is probable that present production of recovered nickel amounts to only 50% of capacity, which is estimated at 500 tons of metal per annum. Some nickel may also be produced direct from Petsamo ores, in a small smelter which formerly treated Moroccan nickel-cobalt ores. These works also include a lead refining plant which had an annual capacity of 36,000 tons before the war. Other installations are a small cobalt refinery and sulphuric acid plant. The latter is estimated to have had a capacity of 40,000 tons per annum in 1938.</p></item>

The Continental rubber works are estimated to supply 80 per cent of Germany's aero tyre requirements, and the Hanomag factories are of outstanding importance in the manufacture of A.F.V.'s, gun carriages, tractors, and military transport. There are a number of other large-scale industrial works, the products of which include wire and cables, A.A. and field guns, non-ferrous metal fabrication, accumulators, chemicals, and textiles. The industries are mainly grouped to the North West and West of the town. The area that extends from Brink (North of Hanover) Westwards along the Mittelland Kanal to Nordhafen and Stöcken has been selected for the development of several of Germany's new armaments plants. The Hackethal cable works, a large new accumulator factory, and new works of Continental and Hanomag, are included in this area. To the West of Hanover, in the suburbs of Leinhausen and Linden, are the parent works of Continental and Hanomag, and a number of other engineering works which are described below. In Misburg, and outlying suburb three miles to the East of the city centre, is an important oil refinery, which has been built on the Western edge of an extensive oil field. Misburg has also been selected as the site for a recently-constructed ordnance factory. A small coalfield lies in the region of Barsinghausen, 8 miles to the South West of the town.</p><list type="industries_infrastructure">

Georg Egerstoff (Hanomag) is an old-established engineering firm which formerly manufactured main-line and narrow-gauge locomotives and steam engines, but which since 1930 has concentrated on their own type of motorcar and tractors and agricultural machinery. In recent years they have become highly-important builders of tanks, and heavy military vehicles. In addition to the various heavy transport vehicles, Hanomag are also important producers of a variety of other heavy armaments products. They are reported to employ a total of at least 20,000 workers. The parent works occupy a large area on either side of the Hamelnerstr. in the South Western suburb of Linden. The Linden works have been developed into one of the major units of the German armaments industry, and they supply a large proportion of the requirements of tanks, armoured cars, gun carriages, artillery tractors and military transport of all kinds. In July 1942 this plant is said to have produced a total of 321 tanks, including 196 light and 125 medium tanks. A second large factory has been recently completed in Brink to the North West of the city, and although reports indicate that the new works is entirely operated by the Hanomag concern the probability remains that at least parts of it are a Reichswehr ordnance depot. <pb n="338" xml:id="page_338" facs="https://gutenberg-capture.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454478"/>The factory at Brink, which it is believed was originally intended as a locomotive works, the manufacture of which had ceased at the Linden works in favour of heavy military transport has now probably the same range of products as the Linden works.

With an installed capacity of 136 MW, this is one of the principal power stations in Western Germany. The Braunschweigische Kohlen Bergwerke A.G. (BKB), the owning company, represents the interests of the Elektrowerke A.G. (EWAG) and Preussische Elektrizitäts A.G. (PEA). The station provides power for the main distribution networks of both companies. It also gives supplies to the Elektrizitätswerk Sachsen-Anhalt (ESAG) and the Überlandzentrale Helmstedt A.G., in addition to B.K.B.'s mines and briquetting plants. The main plant includes 3 boilerhouses, the generator house containing 4 turbo generator sets, and an open-air transformer and switching substation for 220 kV and 110 kV which is known as Harbke I substation. Harbke II transformer station, 1 1/2 miles west of the main plant, is part of the main grid and can be brought into use as a standby for Harbke I. substation in the event of damage. This station contains plant for 220 kV and lower voltages in duplication to Harbke I. Harbke II is in process of construction and Harbke 1 is being extended. On account of its connection to several supply systems the Harbke complex occupies an important strategic position in the general network of the country. To the N. it is the main eastern connecting point of EWAG and the western connection of PEA. On 220 kV long distance lines it connects to the E. with Magdeburg, to the S. with the 56 MW station at Gross Kayna, and to the W. with the switching station of Lehrte. There is a 110 kV line to Krottdorf, and local supplies are given at 50 kV and 15 kV. Brown coal is supplied from nearby mines (see under Solid Fuels)</p></item>

Several thousand workers are employed. The great majority of the work requires a high degree of specialised skill and there is an elaborate system of training schools for apprentices. It is believed that no foreign labour is employed in Jena and because of the nature of the work, there is a probably unique concentration of highly skilled labour in this town. Zeiss have now three and possibly four large associated factories in Dresden, (Zeiss Ikon Werke A.G.) and branch factories are known to have been established in Hirschberg and Gorlitz in Silesia. Zeiss controlled affiliated companies are at Stuttgart, Berlin, Rathenow and Vienna. Jena remains, however, the chief training centre for the concern and is by far the largest of the Zeiss works. It turns out the whole range of precision optical instruments required by the armed forces. These instruments are made in their entirety by the Zeiss works, of which one section is devoted to the casting, grinding and polishing of the lenses, while another section deals with the complete manufacture of the precision metal parts of the instruments. The apprentice schools mentioned above, train workers for each of these two sections of the industry. It is worth noting that the Zeiss works at Jena are not an ordinary commercial concern, but since 1891 have been in the hands of a trust. The profits belong to the workers on a co-partnership basis and to the Jena University. It is believed that the Jena Works of Zeiss alone employ some 12,000 workers. The Zeiss company have their own private power station in Jena; it is believed to have a capacity of 24 MW. (See under "Public Utilities").</p></item>

It is on this route that the bulk of coal supplies from the Ruhr to Italy is transported. Karlsruhe is also of some importance for waterway's traffic as its fairly modern harbour, connected with the Rhine by the Stich Canal, has extensive installations for reloading coal. Industrially Karlsruhe is not of great importance. Its main industry is engineering connected with armaments and it is situated mainly in the Eastern and Western outskirts of the town. There are two main target areas:- "A" The inland port connected with the Rhine by the Stich Canal and the industrial area Grunwinkel, between which the town's power station is situated. (An important sector of the railway passes through this industrial area). "B". To the East of the main railway station, the marshalling yard, large railway workshops and the town gas works. Adjacent to the gas works is the important junction of the railway lines to Frankfort on Main and Stuttgart. In the centre of the built-up area of Karlsruhe, between Vorholz Strasse and Garten Strasse is the important small arms ammunition works of the former Deutsche Waffen and Munitionsfabriken A.G. Because of the unfavourable situation of Karlsruhe close to the French frontier this works was partly closed down during the early stages of the war but is now believed to be working again at full capacity employing several thousand workers.</p><list type="industries_infrastructure">

(N/A) Henschels are the leading German locomotives works and in peacetime were capable of building 200 main-line locomotives per annum in addition to a large number of smaller types. Their works were continually enlarged during the first years of the war and with the adoption of standard locomotive types their capacity increased to many times the above figure. One of the most important manufacturers of trucks in Germany before the war, this firm was also of great importance in supplying German requirements for heavy transport vehicles, which were largely used with trailers. Truck production was of relatively small importance in relation to the activities of this firm in other branches of engineering, although in connection with heavy road transport it was an important contribution to the German requirements. Their manufactures include municipal-type vehicles, such as road sweeping, washing and sprinkling machines, and refuse collecting vehicles; and also the "Finkbeiner" producer-gas unit which is one of the 12 types standardised by Germany. It is belived that even before the war at least one section of the parent works (Werk I) was engaged on the design and construction of medium and heavy tank prototypes and it is probable that during the war certain serial production of tanks took place at the Henschel works in co-operation with Wegmann and Co.

Industrially Kehl is of no particular importance but its state owned harbour, which has been considerably extended during the past six years, is important. In this area the prevailing traffic is in transit goods from and to France. Kehl was built in 1896 to compete with Strassburg harbours. In 1938 the total turnover of traffic in Kehl was 1,995,000 tons. In the pre-war period Strassburg handled a greater volume of traffic than any other inland port of France. Rhine traffic at Strassburg harbour 1929-1937 increased from 4.8 million tons to 5.4 million <pb n="386" xml:id="page_386" facs="https://gutenberg-capture.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454526"/>tons and canal traffic for the same period increased from 1.6 to 2.4 million tons. The harbour installations of Kehl consist of three basins 3,500 m., 1,700 m. and 505 m. long respectively, having an average width of 80 m. There are electric cranes, loading bridges, numerous coal dressing plants and extensive storage yards. Over half the inward traffic is from the Lower Rhine and outward traffic is scarcely 1/3 of the inward. Commodities exported are wood, grain, potash, soda, clay, lignite and chemicals. Goods coming from France are potash, iron ore, basic slag, soda, salt, grain, bran and finished products such as shaped iron, chemicals and large quantities of coal via the Saar Canal and Rhine-Main Canal.</p><list type="industries_infrastructure">

This bay, about 11 miles long and a quarter to 4 1/2 miles broad, is considered one of the best havens in Europe. On its Western side is the mouth of the famous Kaiser Wilhelm (or Kiel) Canal, and on the Eastern side, the mouth of the river Schwentiene. Kiel is the principal base of the German Navy and in all respects entirely a naval town, with dockyards, victualling and fuel stores, shipbuilding, engineering and armaments works. The harbour provides anchorage for a large fleet and quick access to the North Sea through the Kiel Canal, which joins the river Elbe at Brunsbüttelkog. Thanks to the canal, Kiel is also safely connected by water with Hamburg, Emden and the Dutch ports. The Canal's total length from Kiel (Holtenau) to Brunsbüttelkog on the Elbe is 53 nautical miles and its depth 37,07 feet. The double lock gates of the Canal are at its Eastern (Holtenau) end and so are the two Easternmost bridges over the Canal, the Levensau bridge and the Prinz Heinrich bridge. Both bridges carry roads, and the local railway line between Kiel and Flensburg passes over the Levensau bridge. There are two principal target areas in Kiel:- a) Stretching from Gaarden to Mönckeberg along the Eastern side of the Kieler Hafen. In this area are the three great shipbuilding yards, the big underground oil-storage plant and ammunition stores, and, in the centre of the area, the largest Naval arsenal in Germany. Of outstanding importance is the construction of U-boats in this area. b) Immediately at and partly to the West of the Mouth of the Kiel Canal, in the Holtenau-Wick district is a group of less important targets. These targets consist of the Canal lock gates and bridges, the power station, oil-storage depots, and some Naval equipment works. A third series of outlying targets includes a plant producing thin shell and air leads, as well as assembling torpedoes, and other plants manufacturing torpedo components, aeronautical instruments, signalling apparatus, and light-metal products. Fifteen miles Northwest of Kiel at Eckenförde there is believed to be a new and important torpedo factory.</p><list type="industries_infrastructure">

</population></placeName><p>Cologne is the centre of trade, traffic, and political activity in the Rhine Province. Although it possesses important industrial establishments, its chief significance lies in its situation at the crossing of a number of trade routes. It is the main railway-centre in the Rhineland, and a very important inland port. The geographical position of Cologne has been the chief factor in determining the nature of its industry. Its proximity to the Ruhr coalfields and its rail, road, and river transport facilities have caused the growth of firms specialising in light and heavy engineering, chemicals, building, and textiles; in peace-time Cologne was also noted for its luxury products, including chocolate and perfumery. Since 1939 there has been an expansion of certain engineering works and other factories engaged on war production. These are concentrated mainly in Ehrenfeld, Kalk, and Mülheim to the East of the city on the right bank of the Rhine. Other industrial districts with a fair number of important war factories are Sülz, Bayenthal, Poll, Deutz, Nippes, Riehl, and Niehl. Further important industrial concerns are to be found in the outlying districts of Heumar, Porz, Rondorf, Hürth, Kalscheuren, Knapsack-Goldenberg, Berrenrath, and Brauweiler. The built-up area of Cologne itself is of no importance from a purely industrial point of view, as it is composed mainly of residential areas with the appropriate shops, offices, and wholesale houses. The population figure of 912,000 includes the outlying townships mentioned above.</p><list type="industries_infrastructure">

Ground reports since that date suggest that the factory has now become of great importance, and although there is no air reconnaissance to confirm this, the reports must be considered of substance in view of the strategic situation of the plant, which is now as favourable as it was at one time dangerous. It has been reported that the factory manufactures hexanitrodiphenylamine, tetryl and T.N.T., and that it has its own nitric-acid plant. It has also been reported that the factory makes nitroglycerine and nitrocellulose. It is not common practice to manufacture high explosives and propellant explosives in the same plant, but since the Kruppamühle factory was used for many years for the production of mining explosives, it probably has a nitroglycerine plant, and for this reason a propellants section may have been developed.</p></item>

Prior to the war the famous Leipzig Trade Fair drew a large conmercial public from all parts of the world. Leipzig's main railway station is the largest in Europe. The Supreme Courts of Law of the Reich are established in the city and Leipzig is also the centre of the German publishing industry. Railway lines radiate from the city in all directions, and there are extensive marshalling yards which form an inportant base for the traffic to the Eastern Front. Leipzig's industries have been developed chiefly on the outskirts of the town and can be divided into two main groups. The first extends from the main station to the North East and South of the city. This area contains several important engineering plants, spinning and weaving mills, and the Northern power station. The second industrial group is on the Western outskirts.This district includes some of the largest wool and cotton spinning mills in Europe and a number of big engineering works. During the war important aircraft assembly plants have been established on the airfield at Mochau on the North-eastern edge of the town area. The city also contains a number of chemical works, mostly engaged on the manufacture of soap and dyestuffs.</p><list type="industries_infrastructure">

There is one switching and transformer station common to both sections, and it is assumed that a large part of the electrical output is supplied to the nearby industrial plant, to which steam is also supplied. The station was under construction at the beginning of the war and details are therefore incomplete.

The plant, which is responsible for a high proportion of the total German production of a number of important chemical products, is of very considerable importance in the German chemical industry. <pb n="440" xml:id="page_440" facs="https://gutenberg-capture.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454599"/>One of its main activities is connected with the tableting and ampouling of pharmaceutical and medicinal preparations, serums and associated products. It is by far the largest tableting and ampouling works in Europe, and, apart from finishing medicinal and pharmaceutical preparations manufactured at the Leverkusen works, also undertakes the tableting and ampouling of practically the entire output of these products manufactured at Elberfeld, the largest German pharmaceutical plant, and Höchst. The heavy-chemical plant at Leverkusen consists primarily of the sulphuric-acid unit, which is estimated to have a capacity of 300,000 tons per year or roughly 11% of the total German capacity. It is the largest German sulphuric-acid unit. The plant is also an important producer of electrolytic caustic soda and chlorine. Leverkusen is also one of the largest German factories making dyes and associated products. Among other preparations made here on a large scale are film base, films, photographic paper, filters and photographic chemicals. The works includes a synthetic-rubber plant producing "Perdurine" rubber, estimated to have a capacity of 4,000 tons per annum. Several, apparently reliable, reports indicate that toxic acids and smoke-producing compounds are prepared at Leverkusen. It is probable that the filling process would be carried out in one of the several filling stations situated within the Cologne area. Situated within the works is the plant of the Titanium G.m.b.H., one of the leading German producers of titanium pignents. It is believed that the Leverkusen works employs more than 20,000 people. The works, which extend for over one mile along the river front, occupies the whole area between the river and the North-to-South railway along the right bank of the Rhine, which here runs parallel with, and approximately 1,100 yards from, the river. The works has extensive rail sidings, rail storage depots, and large harbour facilities.</p></item>

Schlebusch</label> <measure><num>(2)</num><unit unitRef="#priority-rating">priority</unit></measure><p>This factory was of considerable importance in the last war. In 1918 it was one of the most important T.N.T. factories in Germany and produced more than 1,000 tons per month. It was one of the few factories permitted to continue the manufacture of T.N.T. under the Versailles Treaty and was producing 294 tons monthly in 1923. Both ground reports and air photographs suggest that the factory has returned at least to its full former level of activity, and certain extensions appear to have been made. The factory has not only its own nitric-acid plant (as is common practice in large explosives factories), but also its own sulphuric-acid plant using the contact process, which is unusual. It is apparent that T.N.T. is still the chief product of the plant, capacity being probably about 15,000 tons per annum. It is clear that other explosives are also made at Schlebusch but it is not certain what these are. It almost certainly has plant for the manufacture of nitroglycerine, which may now be used for the production of diglycoldinitrate. In the last war the factory produced a small quantity of hexanitrodiphenyl-sulphide, and although this explosive does not now appear to be used by the German forces the plant would be suitable for the manufacture of hexanitrodiphenylamine.</p></item>

Lübeck is the terminus of the Elbe-Trave Canal which connects with the Elbe and Germany's extensive inland-waterways system, and provides direct communication with Berlin and Hamburg. In recent years Lübeck has grown in importance as an industrial transport and trading centre owing to the expansion of the Lübecker Flenderwerke A.G. where submarines and small merchant vessels are built, the construction of a large aircraft-component works, and the enlarging and modernising of the harbour and transport facilities. The Elbe-Trave canal joins the River Trave some 2 miles to the South West of Lübeck. The river Trave breaks into several channels which completely enclose the old inner town. It then flows Northwards for a few miles, turns East and enters the sea at Travemünde, which contains a seaplane base and is also the terminus of a ferry route to Denmark. The industries lie chiefly to the North and West of the town, the residential areas to the South and East. Included in the town's administrative area is the suburb of Schlutup.</p><list type="industries_infrastructure">

There is very little ground information concerning its activities, but it appears to be important. Unfortunately the only air reconnaissance of the region has provided no more than a photograph of a small corner of the explosives factory in which are some storage sheds. The size of these does not contradict the impression that the factory itself is not of considerable size. It is fairly definitely established that penthrite is made in this factory, and it was reported in 1940 that plant for the production of a new explosive for <pb n="452" xml:id="page_452" facs="https://gutenberg-capture.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454611"/>torpedoes and bombs had gone into production. The nature of this new explosive is uncertain, but it may be hexanitrodiphenylamine (which is commonly used in German torpedoes and mines), or it may be hexogen. It is significant that the site of manufacture of hexogen in Germany has not been positively identified, although this explosive is now used by the German forces. The factory is reported to be opened by Dynamit A.G., but its ownership has not been confirmed. It lies 4 kms. from Luniw on the west bank of the river Oder.</p></item>

</population></placeName><p>Magdeburg is the largest town in the Prussian Province of Saxony, and contains heavy and general engineering works of the first order, aero-engine works, an explosives factory, and a large synthetic-oil plant. Its position on the River Elbe and on one of the main North to South trade routes of Europe has given it from the earliest times a commercial and industrial importance which it has maintained up to the present day. It is one of the principal traffic centres of Central Germany, and has a railway junction which is second only to Berlin itself with lines radiating N. to Hamburg and Rostock, E. to Berlin and the Baltic ports, S.E. to Leipzig and Czechoslovakia, S. to Halle, Nürnberg and Munich, and W. to Hanover and the Ruhr. The central German Leipzig-Magdeburg lines have been electrified. The main part of the town is on the left bank of the Elbe, and is a closely built-up area. Industries and groups of industries are situated round most of the town's perimeter. One important group is at Neustadt and Rothensee, on the northern outskirts, but the Grusonwerk of Krupps, which occupies the first place in Magdeburg's industries, is in Buckau, the southern portion of the town. There are large marshalling and goods yards both in Rothensee and in Buckau. The Western quarter of the town, which is known as the Wilhelmstadt, and the Eastern suburb of Friedrichstadt, which is on the right bank of the Elbe, contain groups of industries. The Elbe divides into two channels, forming an island which lies between Magdeburg and Friedrichstadt. This island is itself intersected by a third narrow river channel (the Zoll Elbe)and contains an inland harbour, with warehouses and storage depots. The Mittelland Canal follows an E.-W. course 6 miles N. of the town, but this important waterways route is broken where it should be carried over the Elbe, due to the failure to complete the aqueduct, and also by the double ship lift at Hohenwarthe a mile to the east of the aqueduct. Barges therefore have to negotiate the 40-60 ft. change in level to the river by the Rothensee shiplift, pass down the N.-S. branch canal into the Elbe, and rejoin the Ihle section of the canal by the locks at Niegripp, a distance of some 8 miles by water from the Rothensee shiplift. The town of Schönebeck, 9 miles to the South of Magdeburg, where there are aircraft, ammunition, and chemical factories, is dealt with separately.</p><list type="industries_infrastructure">

</population></placeName><p>The twin towns of Mannheim and Ludwigshafen form an industrial centre of great importance, which lies on either side of the Rhine at the confluence of the Rhine and Neckar. Mannheim, which is itself divided by the river Neckar, lies on the Eastern and Ludwigshafen on the Western bank of the Rhine. The main railway line up the Rhine valley to Basle passes through Mannheim which is a junction for a branch leading through Heidelberg and the Neckar valley to Heilbronn and Stuttgart. To the West a railway crosses the Rhine to Ludwigshafen, Kaiserslautern and the Saar. The harbour area is chiefly concentrated on the right bank of the Rhine immediately North of Mannheim. There are three main industrial areas. The first lies to the North of Ludwigshafen and is entirely covered by the huge chemical works of the I.G. Farbenindustrie concern. These works form the largest industrial chemical complex in Germany. Opposite these works and on the right bank of the Alt-Rhine are many engineering concerns,including Daimler Benz and Brown Boveri. To the South of the City and in the suburbs of Neckarau and Rheinau are chemical and engineering plants, marshalling yards and an airport. Frankenthal, which is situated some five miles North West of Ludwigshafen, is dealt with separately. <pb n="464" xml:id="page_464" facs="https://gutenberg-capture.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454623"/>Inland Port Mannheim (1) The Mannheim port area is divided into two sections which lie on either side of the Neckar in the Northern quarter of Mannheim. The Mühlau-Hafen is between the Rhine and the left bank of the Neckar and contains numerous warehouses, loading quays and rail sidings. The Industriehafen on the opposite side of the Neckar contains, beside the usual quay aid loading facilities, many small industrial undertakings, including engineering concerns, oil storage plants, and grain silos. This port is the main transhipment centre on the Upper Rhine. Inland Port Ludwigshafen (2) The inland port of Ludwigshafen on the left bank of the Rhine extends from the Southern extremity of the I.G. Farbenindustrie Works to the Northern end of the Raschig chemical plant, a total distance of three miles. This is an important transhipment centre for coal and handles a large proportion of the products of the numerous chemical factories in the twin-towns. The area includes warehouses, oil storage plants, and grain silos, and is extensively served by rail sidings. Inland Port Rheinau (3) The Rheinau-Hafen has nearly eight miles of docks and extensive storage and bunkering facilities. Next to the port of Karlsruhe it is the principal coal transhipment centre on the Upper Rhine. Marshalling Yards Mannheim (2) These important yards lie to the South East of Mannheim and have a capacity of 7,000 wagons per 24 hours. Marshalling Yards Ludwigshafen (N/A) The yards at Ludwigshafen can handle up to 2,200 wagons per 24 hours. There is also a railway repair shop in this area. Railway Repair Shop Schwetzingen (3) These important railway workshops employ 1,000 workers on the repair and maintenance of goods wagons and locomotives. They are in the Southern suburb of Schwetzingen.</p><list type="industries_infrastructure">

It is believed that it is also connected, either directly or via Mundenheim, to the nearby I.G. Farben works at Ludwigshafen-Oppau. The station has 11 turbo-generating sets, one of which is housed underground. Cooling water is taken from the river Rhine. Underground 20 kV. lines connect the station with the old Mannheim power station which now serves as a sub-station, with the two other old stations in the city with the old Rheinau station and with the Badenwerke sub-station. In addition there is a double circuit 110 kV line to Mundenheim sub-station of the Pfalzwerke and to the Rheinau sub-station of the Badenwerke.</p></item>

The old station had 6 turbo-generators and the new station is believed to have one generator with a total of 75 MW. generating capacity. The source of water for cooling is the river Rhine, the new station however, though situated close to the river, has two cooling towers. Power is supplied to the associated works, and the stations are believed to be connected with the Mannheim generating station either directly or via the Mundenheim sub-station. Half a mile N.W. of the chemical works an outdoor sub-station, apparently designed for 3 transformers each of 40 MW. capacity, is under construction. It will be connected to three high voltage lines, with the object probably of providing a means of incorporating the greater part of the electricity requirements of the works in the event of damage to the local generating plant.</p></item>

Before the war a coke-oven plant founded by Ruhrchemie and Th. Goldschmidt, produced ethylene, ethylene chlorhydrin, ethylene glycol, ethylene oxide and ethylene glycol ethers. This plant was acquired by Chemische Werke Hüls G.m.b.H. owned jointly by I.G.Farbenindustrie and <pb n="474" xml:id="page_474" facs="https://gutenberg-capture.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454633"/>Bergwerksgesellschaft Hibernia A.G. (which is owned by the Prussian State). The original capital in 1938 was RM. 30,000,000 of which RM. 22,200,000 belonged to I.G. and 7,800,000 to Hibernia. Construction of a synthetic rubber plant was announced early in 1937 and completed in 1940. Unlike the plant at Schkopau, Hüls was designed to make its acetylene from hydrocarbon gases by the electric arc process; otherwise the same four-stage process is used. It is believed that when production first started gas was used from the existing coke oven plant, but at a later date a pipe line from the Gelsenkirchen oil plant was completed and presumably the waste hydrocarbon gases from this plant are now used, either alone or in conjunction with the coke oven gas. It is believed that the styrene and acrylic nitrile also required for Buna production are made within the works. Power comes principally from a plant within the works of about 150 MW. capacity which is owned by Steinkohlen Elektrizität A.G. Essen, (Steag), a subsidiary of the R.W.E. This plant has been leased to Chemische Werke Hüls for fifteen years. Steag has also undertaken to supply any additional current required from its plant at Lünen on the Lippe, and a power line with transformer station is already installed. Coal for the coke oven and power plant is brought in by conveyor from Shaft III of the Auguste Viktoria Colliery owned by I.G., which is situated at the eastern boundary of the works. There is little doubt that the nominal capacity of Hüls is about 30,000 tons per annum and that output was, at least approximately, restored to this figure early in 1944 after the successful attack of June 1943.</p></item>

Munich is the birthplace of the Nazi Movement and has become the headquarters of the Nazi Party. The city is in the Bavarian highlands, and is 1,700 feet above sea level. It lies to the North of the foothills of the Bavarian Alps, and is on the River Isar. Munich is the centre of an important network of railways and has direct connection with France (through Strassburg), with Austria (through Rosenheim), and with Italy (through Innsbruck and the Brenner Pass). Munich was the residence of the Kings of Bavaria. It is a university town, and a cultural centre of European importance. Traditionally the city has long been celebrated for artistic handicrafts, including bronze founding, glass staining, silversmith's work, and wood carving, in addition to the manufacture of astronomical and mathematical instruments. During the present century a big development of Munich's engineering industry has taken place, and there are now several large works, which are of the highest value to Germany's war production, making railway locomotives, aircraft and other engines, chemicals, and rubber tyres. The larger of these firms are mentioned below, including the B.M.W. aero-engine works and the four plants now established in Munich by the Dornier concern. In addition to these, there are reports of further new aircraft and aero-engine factories having been opened in the Munich area by Messerschmitt and Daimler-Benz. Also included in the Munich area are the Oberwiesenfeld airfield district North-west of Munich (where the B.M.W. and other works are situated), the suburbs of Moosach to the North East, Pasing to the West and Höllriegelskreuth which lies about 5 miles South of Munich.

</population></placeName><p>Nürnberg is the second largest city of Bavaria and claims to exceed Munich in the extent of its industrial development. It is a railway centre of great importance as it lies at the intersection of the North-South and the East-West traffic routes. Nürnberg was chosen as the centre of the annual Nazi Party rallies and an area of over 2,500 acres to the South-east of the walled city, on the South bank of the Lake known as the Groser Dutzend Teich, was set aside for this purpose. The building schemes, which were still in process of completion at the outbreak of war, included numbers of vast public buildings, halls and offices, assembling grounds and arenas, and a gigantic stadium dedicated to the supreme manifestations of Nazi showmanship. The old town is to the North of the main railway on either side of the small River Pegnitz, and is surrounded by the original city wall. It is a closely-built area, and its picturesque mediaeval architecture is the chief attraction for Nürnberg's large tourist traffic. The principal industrial area is to the South of the main railway station and lies between the suburb of Schweinau and the Südbahnhof. Among the industries are important makers of vehicle engines, tanks, searchlights and electric motors. There are other industries at Herrnhütte, an outlying suburb to the North East of the walled city. Fürth, a town of 81,000 inhabitants, which almost joins Nürnberg to the West, is dealt with separately (see page 255).</p><list type="industries_infrastructure">

</population></placeName><p>Pforzheim is 15 miles South-east of Karlsruhe at the Northern end of the Black Forest. It is on the main railway line from Karlsruhe to Stuttgart, and is the junction for two minor branch lines leading South into the Black Forest district. Pforzheim is the centre of the precious, semi-precious, and imitation jewellery industry. It is also one of the chief centres for clock and watch making, which is a speciality of the Black Forest region of Baden. These industries were formerly carried out largely in the homes of the individual workers, and it may be said that almost every house in this city is a small workshop, but there are two factories built on a larger scale. Gold and silver refining is carried out in Pforzheim in connection with this jewellery trade. As was the case during the 1914-1918 war, most of the factories and workshops of Pforzheim will have now been turned over to the manufacture of precision parts for instruments, small-arms components, fuzes, clockwork movements, and similar products for which this specialist labour and plant are suited.</p><list type="industries_infrastructure">

The production of calcium cyanamide for the two plants, Piesteritz and Trostberg in Bavaria, is believed to be 125,000 tons per annum. There is also a plant at Piesteritz for the manufacture of concentrated nitric acid, of which the production is 60 tons daily. These works are also reported to be the largest producers of phosphorus in Europe. In 1932 it was reported that the annual production was approximately 30,000 tons. There are three 3-phase furnaces, each consuming 12,000 kW. In normal times a large part of this phosphorus was sent to Wolfen for the manufacture of phosphoric acid, itself used for making nitro-phoska. Phosphorus is used for the manufacture of incendiary bombs, tracer/incendiary S.A.A., simple tracer S.A.A., and larger-calibre tracer shells made with pyrotechnic compositions. Fire-raising ammunition is almost entirely dependent on phosphorus. It is also used in smoke-producing shells for ranging purposes. These chemical works are on the Northern bank of the Elbe on the Western side of Piesteritz</p></item>

The Danube is navigable as far as Regensburg for barges up to 1,000 tons, and goods can therefore be carried from the Black Sea and the Balkans up to Regensburg without transhipment. This port is now of particular value in view of the large amount of Roumanian oil which is shipped to it up the Danube. The pre-war industries of Regensburg also included shipbuilding, the manufacture of tiles, drainage pipes and stoneware, and several small engineering works. There are a number of saw-mills, and the inland port handled a large amount of timber. The Regensburg works of the Messerschmitt A.G., have been greatly developed during the war. The VAWAG have a large alumina works at Schwandorf, 15 miles to the North on the river Nab, which flows into the Danube 3 miles West of Regensburg. These works are described under the heading of Schwandorf.</p><list type="industries_infrastructure">

<item><label>Messerschmitt A.G. Obertraubling</label> <measure><num>(2)</num><unit unitRef="#priority-rating">priority</unit></measure><p>The Messerschmitt concern of Augsburg built their first big branch works in 1937 on a site occupying a large area to the West of the town adjacent to the former civil airport on the Southern bank of the Danube inside the bend which the river makes North of the village of Prüfening. Production began in 1938 and the plant has concentrated ever since on successive models of the Me.109 single-engined fighter. With the expansion programme instituted in the German aircraft industry in 1942-43 output increased considerably until the effective daylight air attack of August 1943. A second Messerschmitt plant has been established by the conversion and extension of a former G.A.F. station at Obertraubling, 4 miles to the South-east of Regensburg. This works was engaged on the assembly of the large Messerschmitt transport glider, (the Me.321) and of the powered version of the same aircraft (the 6-engined Me.323). The August attack on Prüfening was so effective that Me.109 assembly was for the most part transferred to Obertraubling, while Me.321 and 323 assembly began at Leipheim where assembly space had been acquired. Reconstruction of the Prüfening works was vigorously undertaken and production resumed. A series of raids in February 1944 inflicted such severe damage that the plant is thought likely to be abandoned. Obertraubling was bombed in the same February raids with equal effectiveness and no attempts at assembly repair work had been <pb n="568" xml:id="page_568" facs="https://gutenberg-capture.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454727"/>made by early April.

The industrial targets in the area are concentrated in a narrow strip of territory which extends East from the river Rhine and is about 30 miles long and 10 miles wide; and which lies approximately between the river Ruhr and the Rhein-Herne canal. The Ruhr and the adjacent areas in Rhineland and Westphalia contain a concentration of industry which is without parallel in Europe. An almost unbroken chain of great industrial cities runs from Duisburg in the West through Oberhausen, Mülheim, Essen, Gelsenkirchen, and Bochum to Dortmund in the East. Notwithstanding the policy of industrial dispersal and the heavy air attacks, there has been no appreciable movement of heavy industry away from the Ruhr to safer areas and, although strenuous efforts have been made to develop new heavy industrial plants elsewhere, the Ruhr area retains nearly all of its pre-war importance as the principal centre of heavy industry in Germany. Division into districts For the purpose of this report the Ruhr has been divided into 14 districts, under which headings they should be sought in the text. These conform roughly with the district boundaries as marked on the G.S.G.S. (4081 series) maps of Germany; a map showing these boundaries is included in volume one. West to East these districts are:- Duisburg Oberhausen Mülheim Bottrop Gladbeck Essen Gelsenkirchen Wanne-Eickel Wattenscheid Herne Bochum Castrop-Rauxel Witten Dortmund. Localities bordering on the Ruhr area are described under their own heading with the following exceptions:- Herten and Oer-Erkenschwick are described under the heading "Recklinghausen"; Hüls under "Marl"; Haspe, Gevelsberg and Schwelm are under "Hagen"; Barmen and Elberfeld under "Wuppertal"; and Hohenlimburg under "Letmarthe".</p></item>

In 1935, lorry production was transferred to a new plant at Brandenburg, many of the components continuing to be made at Rüsselsheim, however. At the outbreak of war car production was stopped and a portion of the plant was converted to the manufacture of air-frame components for Junkers 88 aircraft. Aircraft propellor reduction gearing for Daimler-Benz aircraft engines was also manufactured. In addition, large quantities of vehicle spare parts continued to be made, Rüsselsheim being responsible for maintaining the Opel service and repairs organisation, whilst parts were sent to the lorry producing plant at Brandenburg. It was reported early in 1943 that Rüsselsheim was to concentrate upon lorry production, and several reports concerning the manufacture of lorries at this plant have been received. On the other hand, several references to the manufacture of aircraft engines have been received in 1943. In addition, reference has been made to the manufacture of armoured cars, tracked motor cycles, and amphibious vehicles. The number of workers has been variously reported and the whole Rüsselsheim complex would appear to employ 20,000 to 25,000 workers including a large number of foreigners</p></item>

These dams and their reservoirs, which impound a water volume almost equal to the annual flow of the Saale, are among the largest in Germany. The water power thus created is used to serve an important hydro scheme. The four generating stations described below are now fully developed, and it is probable that plans exist for further constructions which will greatly increase the output. Near Saalburg, 20 miles South-east of Saalfeld, is the Bleiloch dam and reservoir and its adjacent Burgkhammer compensating reservoir. The generating stations of these two have capacities of 40 MW and 5 MW respectively. A pump-storage station operates between the two reservoirs. Four miles South-east of Saalfeld, near the village of Kaulsdorf, is the Hohenwarte dam and reservoir and its adjacent Eichicht compensating reservoir. The generating stations of these two have capacities of 50 MW and 5 MW respectively. A pump-storage station operates between the two reservoirs. <pb n="592" xml:id="page_592" facs="https://gutenberg-capture.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454751"/>It is planned to construct a further pump-storage station of 368 MW capacity using the Eichicht compensating reservoir as a lower reservoir and a high level reservoir in the hills on the left bank of the River Saale. An indoor substation, owned by the Thüringenwerke A.G., Weimar, is situated 270 feet above the Bleiloch generating station, and contains two 10/50/100 kV transformers of 20 MW. capacity. 100 kV lines go to Herlasgrün and Hof. A 50 kV double-circuit line goes to Jena. Local supplies are given at 10 kV and the stations of the group are inter-connected at this voltage. The planned 220 kV long-distance line linking the power stations of the Alps with central and eastern industrial Germany will pass through Bleiloch via Gebersdorf.</p></item>

It is near the southern boundary of the Saar area and is on a main railway line which follows the valley of the River Saar to Trier. Saarbrücken is a railway junction for several branch lines serving the industrial regions of the Saar and of Lorraine. The coalfields of the Saar Basin, which extend mainly to the North of the town, are among the largest in Europe and, together with the rich iron-ore deposits of Lorraine, they yield raw material for the highly-developed iron and steel industry in these regions. Several iron and steel works are established in Saarbrücken itself. The industries include a number of engineering works which, though individually on a small scale, constitute in the aggregate a valuable factor in the German war production. The industrial area extends along the valley of the River Saar from the outskirts of Völlingen (5 miles to the West) to Brebach and Neuscheidt, 3 miles to the East of Saarbrücken. The river Saar is navigable and is an important means of transport for the products of this region.</p><list type="industries_infrastructure">

</population></placeName><p>The great iron ore deposits of Salzgitter just north of Goslar in the Harz region and S.S.W. of Brunswick have been worked on a small scale for many years, and, following the loss of Lorraine in 1919, their large scale operation was discussed by German geologists and metallurgists. According to a report published in 1934 by the Prussian Geological Institute (Die Eisenerzvorrate des Deutschen Reiches) the size of the deposits of ore that could be worked as an economic proposition was 35 million tons while there was a further 65 million tons of ore that would require more favourable business conditions such as cheap freight and higher steel prices before it could be considered. These two categories of ore were at a depth of a few feet to nearly 1,000 feet below the surface, but going to a depth of 3,500 feet at least 400 million tons of ore were available. It has since been stated that the estimate of volume of ore was much too low. Features common to all the Salzgitter ores are their high phosphorus content, which makes them suitable for the basic Bessemer process, and their high silica content, which, until the discovery by Brassert of the means of using acid burdens in blast furnaces, rendered them unsuitable for smelting without the mixture of other ores. The greater part of the Salzgitter ores have an extremely low iron content but among the best grades are some with an iron content of about 40 per cent. Before the introduction of the Brassert process and the erection of the Reichswerke Hermann Göring, the best Salzgitter ores were mined to the extent of a few hundred thousand tons per annum by the nearby Ilseder Hütte of Peine, which mixed them with the limey Peine ores, and by certain Ruhr works which mixed them with imported ores. Following the successful introduction in the mid-thirties of acid burdening at Corby in Northamptonshire where the ores are also sicilious, the large scale working of Salzgitter ores became a practical proposition provided a works was erected on the spot. In pursuance of its policy of aiming at raw material self-sufficiency the Nazi Government therefore decided to build such a plant and to link it by a special canal with the Mittelland Canal so as to provide cheap transport to and from the Ruhr. In the barges bringing the necessary coking coal for the works' own coke ovens it was planned to send back Salzgitter ore to the Ruhr works. Thus, as a result of Government action, conditions were created for the use of Salzgitter ores to an extent far exceeding anything conceived by the Prussian Geological substitute. There are now a number of iron ore mines in operation in this area. As already indicated some are of the surface or quarry type and none represent suitable "objectives".</p></item>

Examination of photographic cover prior to the attack on the plant early in 1944 suggests that on the basis of the size of buildings, etc., the T.N.T. capacity may be of the order of 40,000 tons per annum. There are two large T.N.T. manufacturing units which appear to be identical, and one smaller unit of somewhat different layout.

The photographs suggest that, in addition to T.N.T. amatol is also prepared in this plant by mixing some part of the T.N.T. production with ammonium nitrate. This may be the explanation of the very high figures for T.N.T. output which have been given from some sources. Ground sources have suggested that there are two factories making explosives at Schönebeck. This is not confirmed by air photographs, and it is suggested that the second explosives factory reported is in fact the Patronen Zündhütchen und Metallwarenfabrik, which is a fuse-making establishment in the neighbourhood, and which has mounded buildings for the storage of explosives and detonators. The high-explosives factory lies in open country on rising ground on the south bank of the river Elbe, about 2 km. due west of Schönebeck railway station, and 1 1/2 km. south-west from the river bank. Ground reports have stated that shells are also filled in this factory, but air photographs do not confirm this, and it would be very unusual practice to use an explosives factory for filling weapons. It is probable, however, that there is a filling factory in the immediate neighbourhood. The factory was almost completely destroyed only in 1944, probably as a by-product of the raid of January 21/22, 1944 on Magdeburg.</p></item>

During the latter half of 1943 the number of foreign workers, which had hitherto been small, was increasing continually, mostly Frenchmen and Ukrainians of both sexes being engaged. Although the firm's payroll has increased from 5,000 to 13,000 in the course of the war it is unlikely that the number of workers actually employed in the Junghans factories has increased to any major extent because they were already working to capacity before the war. It is assumed that some 7,000 to 8,000 workers are employed by sub-contractors or are "home workers"</p></item>

It is on the railway route from Northern Germany to Stuttgart and on the East to West line from Bamberg to Mainz and the Rhine valley. The Main is already navigable for heavy barges as far as Aschaffenburg, but it is possible that the project to connect the Main with the Danube has already progressed upstream beyond Schweinfurt, in which case the hitherto small inland harbour will have increased in importance. Schweinfurt is the largest centre of the German ball bearing industry and normally produces well over half the total requirements. This manufacture is carried on mainly in four large factories which are grouped round the main railway station on the South-western outskirts of the town. The technical equipment and individual skill required in this industry, on which many engineering and armament branches depend have been developed over a long period and have made Schweinfurt a highly specialised industrial community which it is difficult to transplant or replace. As a result of several bombing attacks very severe damage has been done to the four principal factories.</p><list type="industries_infrastructure">

Not only is nitro-cellulose made in large quantities for the production of celluloid-type plastics, but a variety of other plastic materials, <pb n="623" xml:id="page_623" facs="https://gutenberg-capture.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454782"/>among which laminated articles made from bakelite are perhaps the most important, are also made here. It is quite likely that some explosive nitrocellulose is still manufactured here, and indeed this view is supported by the examination of air photographs. It is difficult to estimate what part of the nitrocellulose capacity is available for explosives manufacture. The total installed capacity represents about 12,000 tons per annum, but the majority of this will certainly be used for plastics manufacture. The factory is important as being one of the largest producers of detonators in Germany. It introduced the manufacture of lead azide detonators in aluminium caps. Even before the war the production of these detonators was running at the rate of about 120 million per annum, and there is little doubt that it has been increased since. The factory prepares its own raw materials for detonators, having a sodium azide plant with an output in excess of 160 tons per annum. The factory is situated 13 miles south-east of Cologne.</p></item>

The iron ore of this area is among the best that is mined in Germany; it is non—phosphoric and suitable for the production of spiegeleisen and also contains a proportion of manganese. In 1937 the area produced a minimum amount of 1,517,000 tons of iron ore and employed 4,900 workmen. The output was mostly consumed by local blast furnaces though a little found its way to Rhenisch-Westphalia. Siegen is also a junction for three minor branch lines. It is at the Southern end of a line of industrial settlements which extend, mostly along the valley of the River Lenne, from Siegen to the vicinity of Hagen, and which contain a large number of rolling mills, wire drawing, and metal working plants, and foundries. Siegen itself has a number of foundries specialising in the production of rollers for steel rolling mills, and is responsible for a high proportion of the German requirements of this essential component.

(2) Haan, with a population of 11,600 Total 153,600 The city of Solingen itself lies 740 feet above sea-level in a bend of the river Wupper, about seven miles South of Wuppertal. It is connected by rail with the great industrial centres of the Ruhr, but is not in itself an important railway centre. Solingen is known as "the Sheffield of Germany" on account of its world-famous light engineering industry which is mainly concerned with the production of cutting machines, tools, knives, scissors, and surgical instruments. Bicycles and components for motor vehicles and small arms are also manufactured. The suburbs of the city - Wald to the North-west, Ohligs to the West, and Gräfrath to the North - are also industrialised, and some of the larger engineering plants are to be found in these areas. The outlying settlements of the Solingen district are, for the most part, non-industrial, with the exception of Haan whose fair-sized engineering works were mainly engaged on the production of cutlery.</p><list type="industries_infrastructure">

Pre-war reports do not suggest that the factory was of great size, although a large area of ground was reserved for it. A report dated 1938 states that while over 400,000 square metres of land were allocated to the factory, only some 22,000 square metres had been used for buildings at that time. Photographic reconnaissance of July, 1942, shows that the factory has now been much enlarged. Its chief function is plainly the manufacture of T.N.T., and it is estimated on the basis of size of buildings that its output would be at least 20,000 tons per annum. It seems likely that penthrite or tetryl are also made at this factory, and there are certain buildings similar to those usually associated with the manufacture of detonators.</p></item>

It has direct rail communications with Berlin, Frankfurt (Oder), and Danzig, and through the River Oder is joined up to the main North German inland-waterway system. It plays an important part in the seaborne supply arrangements for the Eastern Front. The central area of Stettin is a compact mass composed mainly of dwelling houses and offices. The industrial area extends along the river from the dock area in the south-eastern quarter of the city northwards along the left bank to Gutzlow. Most of the important industrial plants are in this area. The main industry of Stettin is connected with its shipyards. No large vessels are built here, but there is considerable activity in the building and fitting-out of submarines, minesweepers, naval escort vessels, and tank landing craft. The shipyard area is in the neighbourhood of Grabow, which is on the left bank of the river one mile to the North of the main railway bridge. The Vulkan shipyards have been considerably extended during the war. Opposite the shipbuilding yards is the Bredow Werder, a large island in the channel of the Oder, which is in process of being converted into an industrial area and naval base. At the South end of this island a large dock basin has been excavated. The port or dock area is on the right bank of the Oder immediately North of the marshalling yards, and in the neighbourhood of the docks is a large concentration of warehouses, timber yards, oil depots, and small factories. <pb n="646" xml:id="page_646" facs="https://gutenberg-capture.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454806"/>In Pommerensdorf, a southern suburb of Stettin, there are chemical works and a large electric power station, which are described below. An important factory lying outside the general industrial area is the Stoewer Werke A.G., which is situated to the West of the town in the suburb of Westend. The outlying district of Pölitz, 8 miles to the North of Stettin, contains an important synthetic-oil plant and an electric generating station. These are included with Stettin in the list below.

</population></placeName><p>Stuttgart, the capital of Württemberg, is the most important industrial town in Southern Germany. It lies in a valley surrounded by wooded hills which open out in the East into the valley of the river Neckar. The town has grown in size considerably since the end of the last century, the development being due mainly to the engineering industry consisting principally of light and electrical engineering. Together with the adjoining suburb of Zuffenhausen, Feuerbach forms one of the chief industrialised quarters of the Stuttgart district. The second industrial area is in Cannstatt and Münster, which are to the North of the city centre and on the left bank of the river Neckar. This area includes an important ball-bearing works, the town's electric power station, and several precision-engineering works. A third industrial district is East of the city centre and on the right bank of the river, extending Southeastward from Untertürkheim up the river valley to Esslingen. The highly important main plant of the Daimler-Benz concern is in Untertürkheim, which also contains large marshalling yards and railway-repair shops. Halfway between Untertürkheim and Esslingen are the "Index" works of Hahn and Tessky, one of Germany's leading makers of machine tools. The manufacture of machine tools and measuring instruments is a highly-developed industry in Stuttgart and also in the neighbouring settlements of Esslingen, 4 miles to the South-east. It is characteristic of Stuttgart, as indeed of the whole of Württemberg, that in normal times industry tends to remain in the hands of a large number of medium-sized or small firms. This is particularly the case with machine tools, and it is, therefore, not possible to include all the numerous firms which in the aggregate make Stuttgart a vital factor in the German engineering industry. Stuttgart is an important railway centre and is on the main routes from the North to Zurich and from Munich to Karlsruhe and France.</p><list type="industries_infrastructure">

Untertürkheim</label> <measure><num>(1)</num><unit unitRef="#priority-rating">priority</unit></measure><p>The principal pre-war activity of this company was the manufacture of motor vehicles, and it is believed that the major part of the very extensive old Daimler-Benz works at Untertürkheim is still employed on work connected with the motor-vehicle industry. This aspect of the Daimler-Benz production is dealt with below, under "Engineering and Armaments", and the following relates exclusively to those parts of the works which are believed to be engaged on aero-engine work. For several years prior to the war the Daimler-Benz company undertook the development of aero-engines, and prototypes were built and tested at this works. It is thought that up to 1939 no large-scale production of aero-engines was undertaken, except at the branch factories at Genshagen and Marienfelde, near Berlin. Reports suggest that these two factories were supplied with components from Untertürkheim. It is not definitely known when the complete construction of aero- engines at Untertürkheim commenced, but it seems probable that it was during the early part of 1942. Up to the end of that year aero-engines erected at Untertürkheim were transported to Sindelfingen for testing, but since then the Untertürkheim works has been very greatly extended, and it is clear from reconnaissance photographs that most of the sections are connected with the production of aero-engines, which is now taking place at Stuttgart on a large scale. Several series of engine test-beds have been erected, and it is believed that Untertürkheim now represents one of the principal production centres for Daimler-Benz engines.</p></item>

Untertürkheim</label> <measure><num>(1)</num><unit unitRef="#priority-rating">priority</unit></measure><p>Owing to its interests in other industries (particularly the aero-engine industry - see above) the Daimler-Benz company is the largest motor-vehicle concern in Germany. In terms of output the Untertürkheim plant is second only to Opel, its 1938 production figures being 20,000 passenger cars and 6,000 commercial vehicles. There is reason to believe that the manufacture of commercial vehicles, particularly lorries, has increased considerably in the course of the war, and that there has been a corresponding decline in the output of cars, production of which is confined mainly to military types. Several sections of the Untertürkheim plant are engaged on the manufacture of components for motor vehicles, which are partly supplied to <pb n="662" xml:id="page_662" facs="https://gutenberg-capture.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454822"/>their branch works at Gaggenau and Sindelfingen. No definite information regarding the number of workers at present employed at Untertürkheim is available, but ground reports suggest that the total is approximately 20,000, including the very large number of workers employed in the aero-engine sections described above (under "Aircraft and Aero-Engines").</p></item>

A second works in this area is in the middle of Stuttgart (west of the main railway station) but although it has been repeatedly extended since 1939 it is not as important as the Feuerbach works. The outstanding value of the Bosch works to the German armament industry is their very large output of fuel injection pumps, magnetos, sparking plugs, and batteries, as well as the usual Bosch range of electrical accessories for internal combustion engines. In addition the Feuerbach and Stuttgart works make a wide range of other electrical appliances such as components for search-lights, head-lamps,etc., but there are, of course, only of secondary importance. Bosch operate a subsidiary factory at Klein-Machnow near and also an affiliated factory in German occupied territory but it is estimated that the Stuttgart factories of Bosch still account for more than half of Germany's total requirements of fuel injection pumps, magnetos, sparking plugs, and other electrical accessories for internal combustion engines. It is estimated that the Feuerbach works employs some 20,000 workers and that a further 10,000 hands are engaged at Stuttgart-Militär Str.</p></item>

It is the junction for an important branch line leading South to Friedrichshafen, and for three minor branch lines serving the surrounding district. The central area of the town is dominated by the famous "Münster" which is believed to be the largest Gothic Cathedral in the world; its steeple is 528 feet high and it is thus the highest steeple in Europe. The most important industrial undertaking in Ulm is the Magirus A.G. This firm specialises in fire-fighting equipment, but has now also attained a high degree of importance as a producer of A.F.V's and heavy armoured vehicles. There is a non-ferrous metal fabricating plant, which is described below, and several other engineering works, some of which are working exclusively for Magirus. There is also a small textile and leather industry. The Messerschmitt aircraft assembly works at Leipheim 10 miles east of Ulm, are included in the list given below.</p><list type="industries_infrastructure">

In 1936 the firm was taken over by the Klöckner-Humboldt-Deutz concern and the former Magirus company was liquidated. It is, however, still usual to refer to the works in Ulm as the Magirus Werke. In addition to their normal fire-fighting equipment, they are now believed to have taken up the production of A.F.V's or tanks on a large scale, and a number of reports indicate that Magirus has become a highly important supplier of heavy armaments. Magirus have two works in Ulm proper (Werk I and Werk II)and a third large plant has now been established in Neu Ulm, the quarter of the town which lies on the right bank of the Danube. The works referred to as Werk I are in the Schillerstrasse close to the railway bridge across the Danube. The second works are in the Blaubeurenstrasse in the Western suburb of Söflingen. They occupy a large area South of the Western end of the marshalling yards and are bisected by the small stream know as the Blau which flows through the town and into the Danube near the railway bridge. There are several other factories (saw mills, roof-felting makers, a rayon mill, and a fertiliser factory) grouped round the Magirus works area. It is <pb n="686" xml:id="page_686" facs="https://gutenberg-capture.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454847"/>thought probable that these two original works (Werk I and Werk II) are still mainly engaged on the production of fire-engines and equipment, particularly in view of the severe damage to Metz of Karlsruhe, and that the A.F.V's or tank production is carried out mainly by the new works in the Neu Ulm area. One report, however, indicates thatsome of the tanks are assembled at Werk II. Other products of this Ulm factory are reported to be Diesel engines, lorries, light transport-column vehicles, tractors, smoke-screen devices, propellers and shafts and other components for midget submarines. Reports suggest that in 1945 chenillettes, small tracked vehicles for reconnaissance, were being turned out. Reports state that up to 1944 the new works mainly built semi-tracked armoured cars, but that the serial production of tanks was expected to begin shortly. The number of workers employed by Marigus has been variously reported, and is certainly well over 15,000 in total.</p></item>

The dam near Waldeck impounds 202 million tons of water in the Edersee, and serves three main purposes, namely: to store water for improving navigation on the River Weser, to control flood waters, and to supply power for electricity. There are 4 generating stations. The Hemfurth I station near the Edersee dam has a capacity of 14 MW. Hemfurth II, one mile downstream, which is equipped with pumped-storage plan, has a capacity of 18 MW. To compensate for the irregular flow through the turbines of the two Hemfurth stations, <pb n="695" xml:id="page_695" facs="https://gutenberg-capture.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454857"/>a weir, the Affoldern, 3 miles downstream, has been built to create a compensating reservoir. The generating station at Affoldern has a capacity of 3 MW. Finally, in 1933, a large pumped-storage station was built on the bank of the Affoldern compensating reservoir which was used as a lower reservoir, the upper reservoir being artificially constructed on the flat top of the Peterskopf Mountain in the Bringhausen Forest. This generating station, known as the Bringhausen station, has a capacity of 120 MW and is used for meeting peak loads and emergencies. The Bringhausen pumped-storage system is one of the largest of its kind. The upper reservoir is 980 feet above the generating station, and has an effective water content of 760,000 tons. The penstock consists of two parallel pipes 3,150 feet long, tapering in diameter from 8 feet at the top to 7 feet at the bottom. There is an adjoining table railway. The Eder dam was breached by air attack in May 1943 and the reservoir largely depleted of water, while the power stations escaped serious damage. The reservoir has since been drained as part of the reconstruction work now in progress.</p></item>

This scheme embraces a system of 15 hydro electric power stations of which some are under Swiss control. Waldshut lies geographically in the centre of this chain of stations. The German-controlled stations are Rheinau (35 MW), Eglisau (35 MW), Reckingen (36 MW), Waldshut-Kadelburg (37 MW), Albbruck-Dogern (72 MW), Laufenburg (68 MW), Säckingen (45-75 MW), Riburg-Schwörstadt (104 MW), Rheinfelden (65 MW), and Augst-Wyhlen (51 MW). The Swiss-controlled stations are Schaffhausen (16 MW), Rheinfall (100 MW), Beznau (25 MW), Klingnau (35 MW), and Birsfelden near Basle (50 MW). Special features of this hydro scheme are the unusually constant flow of Lake Constance, and the fact that the maximum flow is in July, and the minimum in February, owing to the freezing in winter of the high Alpine water sources which feed this part of the river. It is thus possible to maintain a high electrical output all the year round, with a maximum value in summer, when most other hydro schemes are obliged to operate with reduced output. <pb n="698" xml:id="page_698" facs="https://gutenberg-capture.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454860"/>The scheme has been jointly developed by the German and Swiss Governments.

<item><label>Hydro Scheme Schluchsee</label> <measure><num>(1)</num><unit unitRef="#priority-rating">priority</unit></measure><p>The Schluchsee hydro scheme in the Black Forest is designed for an ultimate capacity of approximately 400 MW. When fully developed it will use the 1,970 ft. head between the Schluchsee lake and the River Rhine at Waldshut, a distance of 12 miles. The work was planned in three stages. Stage one included the damming of the Schluchsee, creation of a reservoir of 108 million tons capacity, and the building of a pumped-storage station at Häusern for a head of 660 ft. Stage two was the building of a pumped-storage station at Witznau for a head of 930 ft. Stage three, which is still projected, is the building of a pumped-storage station at Waldshut for a head of 380 ft. Below Häusern and Witznau generating stations there are two reservoirs of 1.3 and 4.5 million tons capacity respectively, to serve as daily and weekly storage basins. In 1929 construction was begun on the first stage (Hausern) and on a provisional compensating station at Eichholz. This work was completed in 1933, the installed capacity of the generating plant at Hausern being 104 MW. and at Eichholz 30 MW. In 1938 construction was begun on the second stage (Witznau), the intention being to close down Eichholz when this was completed. It is believed that this work was finished in 1942, the installed capacity of the generating plant at Witznau being approximately 176 MW, and the total for the scheme as then developed 280 MW. The scheme provides for maximum output in the winter months, and is designed to compensate for the reduced output of the Upper Rhine stations when the Alpine water supplies are frozen. The projected pumped-storage station, which has yet to be built at Waldshut, is planned to have a capacity of 100 MW.</p></item>

It is 40 miles North-west of Bremen and is at the end of a branch railway from Bremen via Oldenburg. It is the Eastern terminus of the Ems-Jade Canal and thus has access to the Dortmund-Ems Canal system. Wilhelmshaven is one of Germany's largest naval bases and is the headquarters of the North Sea Western Group and North Sea Coastal Defence Commands. The naval shipbuilding yards of Wilhelmshaven (the Kriegsmarine Werft) have built many famous German warships, including the 35,000 ton battle-cruiser Tirpitz. In the past few years, however, the port has chiefly concentrated on the building of submarines, mainly of the 500-ton class. The yards at Wilhelmshaven also undertake the repair and maintenance of E-boats and other light craft of a similar type. There are a number of oil-storage depots without the port area, described below under Liquid Fuels, but apart from the one firm listed under Engineering and Armaments, Wilhelmshaven contains no other industries of importance.</p><list type="industries_infrastructure">

The yards of the Kriegsmarine Werft are situated in the Bau-Hafen which lies to the East of the town. It is the innermost of the harbours and has access to the sea via the Ausrüstungshafen. The Grosser-Hafen is the chief coaling and commercial port and lies immediately South of the town. It includes extensive quay and loading facilities, oil-storage plants, and rail sidings. Immediately to the West is the Zwischen-Hafen which contains one large and two small floating docks. The main coal-loading quays are in the Zwischen-Hafen. Further West is the West-Hafen which includes the yards of the Deutsche Werke A.G. On the long sea-wall which divides the main docks from the Jade Busen are a number of oil-storage installations and the seaplane base which is mentioned below under "Aircraft and Aero Engines". The Ems-Jade Canal enters the port from the West, passes through the Kanal-Hafen (a channel with loading facilities which extends along the landward side of the dock system), and terminates in the Grosser-Hafen. In the last few years reclamation work has been in progress immediately to the North-east, of the main port area where the coastline curves round to the Northward and it is reported that a new dock, outer port, and other harbour installations are in process of construction</p></item>

During the last war it manufactured almost the whole range of military explosives, including T.N.T., nitrocellulose, picric acid, nitroglycerine, dynamite, and propellant powders. There is a certain amount of ground information regarding its present activities, which is fortunately supplemented by excellent air photographs, dated May, 1943. <pb n="733" xml:id="page_733" facs="https://gutenberg-capture.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454895"/>The present lay-out of the plant agrees reasonably well with its ground plan at the end of the last war, with the significant difference that the T.N.T. manufacturing unit has been removed. The nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine plants do not appear to have been much altered, and there appears to be some capacity for the manufacture of finished propellant powders. In 1938 it was reported that the Reinsdorf factory produced 15,000 tons of nitro-cellulose per annum, which is a little below the estimate of capacity made by the Armistice Commission in 1919. Examination of air photographs taken in May, 1943, suggests that the nitrocellulose capacity might be about 25,000 tons per annum at the present time. Nitroglycerine, or diglycoldinitrate, plant appears to be installed, and the capacity may be very roughly estimated at about 6,000 tons per annum.</p></item>

Wurzburg is an important railway centre, and two trunk lines pass through the town from Frankfort/Main to Nuremburg, and from North Germany to Stuttgart. The main railway station and goods yards are to the North of the central area of the town, which is a closely-built area enclosed by a belt of gardens which have taken the place of the former city walls. North-west and North-east of the central area are large barracks, which up to the outbreak of war were occupied by armoured and motorised divisions. Würzburg is in the midst of a large agricultural district, and is an important flour-milling centre, the industry being in the hands of a number of medium-sized undertakings. Wine and fruit are largely grown in Franconia, and Würzburg has also three large breweries which did a big export trade in peace-time. The other industries are varied, and although none of the individual firms is large, engineering, textiles, varnish and dye manufacture, and furniture-making are all represented and in the aggregate give Würzburg considerable industrial importance. The industries are mainly grouped in the northern and eastern quarters of the town. West of Würzburg there is an important link station on the 110 kV transmission line between the Bayernwerk and the R.W.E.
